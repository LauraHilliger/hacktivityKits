<!-- ======================================================================
Trolling is a phenomenon that happens in the online space. It's a practice where someone (a TROLL) makes comments or remarks for the sole purpose of instigating an online fight. It's harassment! We all know you should treat others the way you wish to be treated, but trolls seem to get a kick out of being MEAN. 

YOU can become a better digital citizen by remaining positive and making sure your actions are NOT troll-like.

This page requires a unique blend of HTML agility, CSS wizardry and mental firepower. There are people who are on the web, and then there are people who MAKE the web. Your goal in this project is to remix this troll's story into a story of your own or create a positive example for online behavior. Add images, links and content to this page to create your very own resource and reference page for being a good Digital Citizen.
============================================================================ 

Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

Replace the troll's picture with an image of your own! Find a different character to be nice to or write a story for :) You can take a new picture and upload it to Flickr or your own website, or use an image that is already on the web.

  </div>
  
  <!--
You can change the troll's tagline by changing the text within the <h1> tag. <h1> is used for headings - the "h" stands for header and the "1" stands for most important (versus h2, h3, etc.). Try a different headline for your avatar.
-->
  
  <div class="proclamation">
    <h1>I might be a <span class="hacktivator">TROLL</span>, but I don't troll Online.</h1>
    
    <!--
The <ul> tag is used for bulleted, or unordered lists (versus <ol> for ordered lists). Each <li> tag is a separate list item, or bullet. You can change the text between each <li> tag. You can even try making this an ordered list (Hint: <ol> instead of <ul> and remember to close the tag!)

You might also link out to resources on digital citizenship that you love by using the <a> tag which is used for hyperlinks. The <a> tag has a very important attribute: href, which defines the URL you want to point to. The text you put between the open <a> tag and the close </a> tag will hyperlink the text that shows up on the page, linking to the URL you specify. Try it out!

    <ul>
      <li>I'm respectful in online communities.</li>
      <li>I don't make fun of people.</li>
      <li>If I don't have something nice to say, I don't say  anything.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>When someone makes me feel bad, I look to:</h1>
  <ul>  
    <li>The <a href="http://www.itgetsbetter.org/">it gets better</a> campaign because their videos are inspiring.</li>
      <li><a href="http://bornthisway">Born this Way Foundation</a> because they helped me understand that I'm awesome the way I am.</li>
      <li>The <a href="http://webmaker.org">Mozilla Webmaker Community</a> because my ideas are always welcome.</li>

<!-- 
Congrats on proving that Harry is not a troll! You can still go back and change things - that's the beauty of the Web. You might have missed it, but you actually learned some stuff in this project. You now know how to do comments in HTML and CSS, manipulate some CSS, work with headers (the <h1> tag), use lists (<ul> and <ol>) and bullets (<li>), add hyperlinks to text (<a> tag) and even a little about digital citizenship and responsibility. Way to go, Webmaker!

  <h1>Planning Navigation and Content</h1>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <h5>Designing for your Audience</h5>
    <p> You need to know who your target audience is. A target audience is a group of people that have something in common,
            and it greatly influences many design aspects.</p>
          <p> Think about the type of people you want to engage. Make notes about things like age, family status, computer experience and interests or hobbies.</p>
           <p>Write a general description of your user.</p>
          <p> The <strong>target audience</strong> is important because it helps to answer a bunch of design questions you’re going to have.</p>

    </li>
    <li class="right">
      <h5>Content</h5>
       <p> Write all the content bits and pieces out on little pieces of paper. Then, categorize the pieces. This exercise will give you a logical global navigation (and subnavigation if you have lots of content).</p>
          <p> There’s no one way to organize content. You need to have a feel for what your content is, and then categorize
            pieces together. Don’t forget, it’s easier to rearrange pieces of paper than electronic data.</p>
          <p> This process doesn’t just help the organization of content, it also helps you begin to think about production resources you will need and a time plan.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Navigation</h5>
     <p> If you’ve worked through the content section, you’ll know that Navigation relies quite heavily on the content. Organizing
            content will reveal logical global and sub navigation. What comes first? Create a hierarchy for your content.</p>
          <p> The site map shows exactly how many navigational items you’ll need as well as the hierarchy of the pages. The creation of a site map will also help you eliminate irrelevant content and know what you need to produce. It’s a good
            idea to take your time with this because without it, it will quickly become confusing where a particular piece of content “lives”. A simple and clear navigation structure is important so that your users don’t get confused or frustrated.</p>

    <h1>Defining Audience</h1>
   <h5>Ask yourself</h5>
   <ul>
            <li>How old are these people? </li>
            <li>Do they have a lot of family obligations? </li>
            <li>Do they have a particular career path? </li>
            <li>How often are they online? </li>
            <li>What are their hobbies?</li>         
   </ul>
   <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Age range:</strong>
              Could impact color scheme, text size, and language used.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Level of computer experience:</strong>
              Impacts viewer’s ability to interact with the site. What are they used to in terms of site design?</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hobbies/Interests/Pastimes:</strong>
              May help to gear and guide the taste of the site as well as point views to other resources within these interests that they enjoy.</li>

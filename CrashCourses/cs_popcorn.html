  <h1>Popcorn's Basic Features</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h5>Templates</h5>
         <p>A template provides a visual layout and is usually designed for a specific kind of project. Each template includes only specific plug-ins to keep the JavaScript as lightweight as possible. Clicking the +Popcorn Button at the
            bottom right of the interface, underneath the “My Events” panel, allows you
            to add plug-ins that are not specific to the template you’ve selected. You
            have to drag the plug-in you’d like to use and drop it in the My Events tray
            to add it to your template.</p>
          <p> You will see the available templates when you load Popcorn in your browser.
            You can also load your own, custom template by selecting “Other.” You
            can’t change your template after you’ve started a project, so choose carefully.
            When you click “create,” your project will be created, and you’ll enter
            the editor view.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right">
      <h5>Events</h5>
      <p> An event is a marker that says “do something” at a specific point in your
            film. To add an event to the timeline, you drag and drop the text from
            the My Events box to the Timeline! To delete an event from the Timeline,
            you click the event and hit the Delete key on your keyboard.</p>
          <p> Popcorn has a great many plug-ins which allow you to pull events into your
            timeline. Because there are many plug-ins and templates, there are infinite
            variations and possibilities. No two Popcorn projects will be the same. But
            the authoring pattern is always the same: <strong>choose a plug-in, add it to the
            timeline, and configure the event.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Tracks</h5>
      <p> A Popcorn Maker project can have an infinite number of tracks. Tracks help you,
            the creator, organize events in the way that seems most logical to you.
            Maybe you want one track to visualize all the Twitter events. Or maybe you
            want one track to visualize all the cat-related events. It’s up to you.
            When you mouse over the name of a track, you’ll see an “X” to delete the
            track. In the track editor, you can see the code for the events that you’ve
            assigned to the track.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right">
      <h5>Saving, Exporting and Publishing</h5>
      <p> You can save your project, export the code of your project and/or publish
            your project to the WWW. In the upper right hand corner of the interface
            are buttons to accomplish these things. Just follow the on screen instructions
            and share your masterpieces with the world! </p>

    <h1>Keyboard Shortcuts</h1>
      <p><img src="static/espace.png" alt="space" height="44"><strong>Spacebar</strong> allows you to Play and
              Pause the video playback. Using this
              shortcut will also update the timeline
              view if the playhead gets lost.</p>

              can move both events on the timeline
              in sync using the <strong>arrow keys.</strong></p>

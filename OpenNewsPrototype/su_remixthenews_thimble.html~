   <!--A setting up activity is one that gives pointed instruction to participants on tools or procedures. An example of a setting up activity would be allowing the participants to get used to the interface of Thimble or Popcorn by having them make projects. Before learners can practically apply new skills, they need to be comfortable with the tools they'll be using and have a basic understanding of the skills they'll be sharpening. -->
    <h3>Setting Up</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Learners use HTML and CSS to remix an article and learn some basic tags and style properties.<br/>

      <p>Start hacking a news article. Learn how to transform a blob of text into an article format welcome on any news organization website. Read up on the introduction to the Thimble project on Webmaker.org, and click the Get Started button at the bottom when ready to work on the article.

Encourage learners to create their own Thimble using text from a story they've worked on or copying and pasting from their favorite site.

    <p>Have participants talk about their hacks and display their pages. Ask them what they had to do to create their project. Reinforce the idea that in HTML, elements have opening and closing tags. Ask learners why syntax and web standards are important.</p><p>
Following the presentations, facilitators should direct participants to other resources in their community or online to learn more about hacking and web design/development. Provide individual constructive feedback during presentations.</p>  </div>

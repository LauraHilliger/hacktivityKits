    <!--An icebreaker is an activity that gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own! -->
    <h3>Icebreaker</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>You might be at an event with a lot of people you don't know. This icebreaker is a really brief go-round to get people talking.</p><p>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Welcome everyone to the space and review any important logistical items: bathrooms, food, water, etc. Help make sure that everyone has access to Internet and a power supply. Introduce folks to OpenNews, Webmaker, and Thimble; review the agenda for the event; and make sure folks have links to relevant documents, such as this kit! </li>
    <li>Start a go-round for introductions. Have each person give three items of information: Name, where they're from (however they want to define that), and what brings them to the event today. </li>
    <li>Wrap up in the welcome with an outline of some basic ground rules: respect time and the schedule; respect communication, so be mindful of vocabulary that might not be familiar to everyone; and the rule of one, rule of n: each person should speak 1/nth of the time.</li>

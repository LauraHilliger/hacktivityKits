Welcome to the Webmaker Creating Goals Template!

Use this template to create learning objectives and goals for your Webmaker session. Then, use the Webmaker Activity Template: https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-activity-template

This page requires a unique blend of HTML agility, CSS wizardry and mental firepower. There are people who are on the web, and then there are people who MAKE the web. Your goal in this project is to MAKE your very own Webmaker learning objectives page. Add images, links and content to this page to create your very own activity page and help others teach the web.
============================================================================ --><!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

Everything contained within this <style> tag is called CSS and it is used to define the presentational components of the page, like fonts, colors, containers, positioning, etc. Remember that in CSS, comments are enclosed in '/*'. You can edit this CSS.

You can change the text within the different <h> tags. <h1> is used for headings - the "h" stands for header and the "1" stands for most important (versus h2, h3, etc.). Try different headlines for your activity.

    <h3>Draw the Big Picture</h3>

  	<!--What skills will your participants LEARN? Try making yourself a list, for example:-->
  <p>For example: I want my participants to learn:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Web is made out of building blocks that they can rearrange to create new things through an iterative process.</li>
<li>HTML is a language used to tell computers how to build webpages so that humans can consume them. CSS means cascading style sheets.</li>
  <li>Parts of a webpage include HTML, CSS, graphic assets and text content</li>
  <li>The combination of an opening tag and its corresponding closing tag and the content in between is called an element</li>
  <li>There are resources on the web for webmaking</li>
  <li>Hacking is FUN!</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Think of the Results</h3>
<!-- 
     What will your learners MAKE when they are done? How will they do that? What tools will they use? List these things out so other Webmaker Mentors can try out your kits!-->
     <p>For example: My learners will make their own webpages using basic HTML tags. They'll also style their webpages using the following CSS properties: positioning values, hex numbers/color, fonts/sizes, class, div</p>
   <p>
We're going to use Thimble!</p>

  <h3>Activate Essential Questions</h3>
  <!--Activate Essential Questions that lead to deep understanding: what do you want your learners to be able to discuss and reflect upon?-->
  <p>For example:  My learners will be able to discuss and reflect upon:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the web made out of?</li>
    <li>How does HTML &amp; CSS allow me to be creative?</li>
    <li>How did feedback help me iterate and improve on my project?</li>
    <li>What does "open web" mean?</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">Note: The purpose of this exercise is to create an outline of learning goals that you can design activities around. </p>

  <h3>Summarize:</h3>
  <!--Summarize your goals and how your learners will reach them-->
  <p>For example: In the identity jam my participants will learn about the open web, HTML and CSS by making their own web pages, swapping images, closing broken tags and creating pages for their alter egos.

Congrats on focusing in on your learning goals! You can still go back and change things - that's the beauty of the Web. You might have missed it, but you actually learned some stuff in this project. You now know how to do comments in HTML and CSS, manipulate some CSS, work with headers (the <h1> tag), use lists (<ul> and <ol>) and bullets (<li>), add hyperlinks to text (<a> tag) and even a little about open educational resources. Way to go, Webmaker!

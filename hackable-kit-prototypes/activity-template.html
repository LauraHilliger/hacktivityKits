                We believe that peer-to-peer activities are the most powerful way to facilitate interaction, build networks, and collaborate. Successful activities are:

              <div class="well example">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Participatory:</strong> Engaging and activating participants from the beginning and getting them making and doing, rather than listening and watching.</li>
                  <li><strong>Purposeful:</strong> Working toward meaningful goals.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Productive:</strong> Well-planned so that concrete outcomes are achieved in the allotted time, and participants feel time was well spent.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Explain each step of the activity so that others can repeat it in their learning situations. Start by explaining how the activity is set up.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Be descriptive! Seeing an activity in action is very different than reading about it, so be as specific as you can.</p>

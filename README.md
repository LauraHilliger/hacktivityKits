<h1>Hacktivity Kit Prototypes</h1>

HTML/CSS hacktivity kits for <a href="http://webmaker.org">Mozilla Webmaker</a> (prototypes!)

We are in the process of creating Hacktivity Kits for each of our software tools and for a variety of event types. The kits contain information on the Mozilla Webmaker initiative as a whole, specific information on the particular tool and event format that the hacktivity kit is for, and then modular content that allows a facilitator to pick and choose what they want to teach and how.

<strong>The HACKtivity kits also contain information on how to hack the kit for your own interests and particular situations. Check the comments!</strong>

I have been brainstorming the best way to create hackable content that is also usable for people who don’t actually want to hack it. I can imagine that certain facilitators just want to teach web literacy as the main theme and need or want a step by step plan in doing that. So these kits are laid out for those educators. But for those people that want to hack it, we need to create a simple framework for creating your own learning materials. I am sold on the idea that this framework for lessons is:

<ol>
<li>Create an orientation (introduction) activity (an Icebreaker Hacktivity - introduces the concepts for the day. It also helps you, the facilitator, assess the prior knowledge of the themes you're teaching.</li>

<li>Create an instructional activity (a Setting Up Hacktivity - introduces the tools and hard skills)</li>

<li>Create a practical activity (a Hands on Hacking Hacktivity - uses a practical project approach to marry high level concepts and hard skills)</li>
</ol>

I'll be updating with a drawing of the kits from a meta level...hopefully soon ;)

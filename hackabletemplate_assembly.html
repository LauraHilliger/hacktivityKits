Welcome to the Webmaker Make a Kit Template!

Use this template to pull together your goals and activities, so that others can teach using your kit. If you haven't yet created goals, start here: And if you need more activities or want to make some resources, remix the Hackable Activity Template: https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-activity-template
This page requires a unique blend of HTML agility, CSS wizardry and mental firepower. There are people who are on the web, and then there are people who MAKE the web. Your goal in this project is to MAKE your very own Webmaker activity page. Add images, links and content to this page to create your very own activity page and help others teach the web.
============================================================================ --><!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

  	<!--Write a few lines to describe who you are, the work you do and what your kit can be used for. You can hack the mad lib below or write your own!-->
  <p>The (organization/working group/club) works with (target audience) to give them the skills they need to understand, shape and actively participate in today's world, instead of just passively consuming it.

Using provided resources like this Kit, people around the world are helping their peers learn web skills.</p>

<p>(Organization) has developed (program name) to help learners gain confidence in (learning goals). (Program name) spreads skills, attitudes and ethics that help you thrive in a remixable digital world. By making it easy for (target audience) to tinker and mess around with the (tool or  processes) that make up (part of) the web, (program name) helps them move from digital consumers to active producers who see the web as  something they can actively produce, remix and make better.</p>

<p>Hacking is even more social and fun in a group, so (program name) gathers a few people together to see what they can make!</p>
  <h3>Tools</h3>
<!-- Give some background on the tools learners will use. Hack the text below or reuse background info on Thimble, Popcorn or the XRay Goggles.-->
     <p>Using (tool name), we aim to make learning (skills) easier and more fun. (Tool name) is a (type of tool) that can be used to help someone learn the basics of (skills).</p>

<p>Letâ€™s dive in. The best way to understand the (tool name) is by trying it yourself. To get started with (tool name) you'll need to (outline steps a facilitator needs to take to set up the tool).</p>

  <h3>Setup</h3>
  <!--Let people know how to use your kit. Is there software to install? Do we need to make sure the computer has a specific browser? Tell us here!-->
<p>Make sure your computer has the latest version of one of the following browsers (to download a browser, click on the link and follow the directions).</p>

</ul>
<p>This kit is organized around learning by making. It uses a hands on, collaborative, project based methodology, so at the bare minimum you'll need a space that allows people to move freely, brainstorming supplies like paper and pens, computers and an internet connection.</p>

Congrats on completing your kit! You can still go back and change things - that's the beauty of the Web. You might have missed it, but you actually learned some stuff in this project. You now know how to do comments in HTML and CSS, manipulate some CSS, work with headers (the <h1> tag), use lists (<ul> and <ol>) and bullets (<li>), add hyperlinks to text (<a> tag) and even a little about open educational resources. Way to go, Webmaker!

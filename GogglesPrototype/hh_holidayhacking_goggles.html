    <!--A Hands on Hacking activity is a practical activity that allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session. Go back to thinking of the results: what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Create a project that gives learners enough time to explore and tinker while working towards the completion of the activity. See all Hands on Hacking Hacktivities at http://www.webmaker.org/hacktivities#handsonhacking-->
    <h3>Hands on Hacking</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Introduce participants to an organic, interactive design process for webmaking. Participants will discuss what it means to have an open web and create a fictional holiday that anyone can participate in.<br/>

    <li> <img src="static/step01_group.png" alt="step01_group" width="119" height="118" style="margin-bottom:45px;">
      <p>Collectively explore problems and strengths of the open web. What would your life be like without the web? Who made the web? How can you tell the web was made by people?</p>
      <h5>Introduce the concept of the open web:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Anyone can use it to make things.</li>
        <li>Transparent, you can see how it is made.</li>
        <li>It doesn’t break because it is not “owned”.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="right">
      <h5>Introduce the design challenge:</h5>
      <img src="static/hh_goggles/step02_holiday.png" alt="step02_holiday" width="170" height="145" class="right">
      <p>We benefit from an open web where anyone can use, see and manipulate content on the Internet. Imagine if those same features applied to holidays. Imagine a holiday for everyone regardless of nationality or religion. What do we all have in common as human beings? What would an open holiday look like?</p>
    </li>
    <li><img src="static/hh_goggles/step03_holiday.png" alt="step03_holiday" width="170" height="145">
      <p>Have everyone create an open holiday. Holidays should have a name, visual representation and a history. Ask learners: What is unique about this holiday? How do people celebrate it? How does the holiday include all people regardless of race or religion or economic status?</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right"> <img src="static/hh_goggles/step04_holiday.png" alt="step04_holiday" width="170" height="145" class="right">
      <p>Hack into a news site using the X-Ray Goggles to write a story about how the holiday is celebrated on each continent. Put the content on a webpage that was created or hacked and present it to the group at the end of the day.

    <!--A Hands on Hacking activity is a practical activity that allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session. Go back to thinking of the results: what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Create a project that gives learners enough time to explore and tinker while working towards the completion of the activity. See all Hands on Hacking Hacktivities at-->
    <h3>Hands on Hacking</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Create a recording in response to the Generation Open question: <strong>If you could make anything on the Web, what would it be and why?</strong> Then make add images, text and tweets by adding Popcorn events to it.<br/>

      <p>Use the <a href="ib_genOpen_brainstorm.html">mindmaps from the first Hacktivity</a> to help you compose an audio recording as if it were being broadcast on the radio. It might be a short poem, a funny story or a short interview. </p>
      <p>Try to answer the questions: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the most basic aspect of my idea? Is it a web app? A game? A website? A communication tool? What is the *thing* I would make on the web?</li>
        <li>Who is it for?</li>
        <li>What problem or issue is it addressing?</li>
        <li>What would it <em>do</em> to address this problem or issue?</li>

      <h5>Introduce the design challenge:</h5> <a href="http://soundcloud.com"><img src="https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1690665610/big_avatar.png" width="124" class="right two"></a><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net"><img src="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/images/Audacity-logo-r_50pct.jpg" width="124px" class="right"></a>
      <p>Design Challenge: How does imagery influence the way someone hears or reads a piece of text? Now that you've composed a poem, narrative or other piece for an audio recording, you'll find web content and images to illustrate your point. If you haven't already, record your text and upload the audio file to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/upload">Soundcloud</a>. If you need a software to record and edit audio files, try <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>. If you need help using Audacity, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=record+with+audacity&oq=record+with+audacity&gs_l=youtube-reduced.3..0j0i5l3.230.2715.0.2843.20.12.0.0.0.0.362.1806.4j1j4j1.10.0...0.0...1ac.1.ub6C-AI_eWo">YouTube has lots of videos on the subject</a>.</p>
      <p>You might want to create a plan for your video using pens and paper. What assets will you collect? What images will you use? Try drawing sketches, <a href="../CrashCourses/schematics.html">storyboards</a> and/or plans of your videos.</p>

Swap the Media Source out with your uploaded Soundcloud file. Use events to illustrate your idea.</p>

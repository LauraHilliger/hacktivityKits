    <!--A Hands on Hacking activity is a practical activity that allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session. Go back to thinking of the results: what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Create a project that gives learners enough time to explore and tinker while working towards the completion of the activity.-->
    <h3>Hands on Hacking</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Report on your Generation Open idea by making your own bedroom broadcast or newscast. Express your answer to the Generation Open question: <strong>If you could make anything on the Web, what would it be and why?</strong><br/>

  <h1>Steps</h1>

    <li> <img src="static/ib/step02_writetheRules.png" alt="small groups" style="margin-bottom:45px;">
       <p>Use the <a href="ib_genOpen_brainstorm.html">mindmaps from the first Hacktivity</a> to help plan your newscast. If you are working in groups, discuss how you will explain your idea.
     <p>Try to answer the questions: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the most basic aspect of my idea? Is it a web app? A game? A website? A communication tool? What is the *thing* I would make on the web?</li>
        <li>Who is it for?</li>
        <li>What problem or issue is it addressing?</li>
        <li>What would it <em>do</em> to address this problem or issue?</li>
      </ul>
       </li>
    <li class="right">
    <h5>Write a script</h5>
     <p><img src="static/ib/step03_writetheRules.png" class="right"> Once you have discussed overarching plans for how you will explain the idea, write a script so you know exactly what you want to say. Writing a script will help you plan the rest of the newscast by giving you a focal point. If you know what you want to say, you'll be able to find images, tweets and popups to help illustrate your point.</p>
	 
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Make a plan</h5>
	    Create a <a href="../CrashCourses/schematics.html">Storyboard</a> to help you outline the newscast. Think about what Popcorn events you'll use to explain your idea. Find images and links on the web that help you explain your idea.
    </li>

      <p>Now, follow the steps in the Webmaker project "<a href="https://www.webmaker.org/en-US/projects/newscast/" target="_blank">Make a Newscast from your Bedroom</a>" to put your newscast together.</p>

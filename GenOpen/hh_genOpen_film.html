    <!--A Hands on Hacking activity is a practical activity that allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session. Go back to thinking of the results: what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Create a project that gives learners enough time to explore and tinker while working towards the completion of the activity.-->
    <h3>Hands on Hacking</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Report on your Generation Open idea by making your own bedroom broadcast or newscast. Express your answer to the Generation Open question: <strong>If you could make anything on the Web, what would it be and why?</strong><br/>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li> <img src="static/ib/step02_writetheRules.png" alt="small groups" style="margin-bottom:45px;">
        <p>Have learners use the <a href="su_genOpen_parse.html">plans from the second Hacktivity</a> to help plan their newscasts. If they are working in groups, have them discuss how they will explain their idea.
     <p>Try to answer the questions: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the most basic aspect of my idea? Is it a web app? A game? A website? A communication tool? What is the *thing* I would make on the web?</li>
        <li>Who is it for?</li>
        <li>What problem or issue is it addressing?</li>
        <li>What would it <em>do</em> to address this problem or issue?</li>
      </ul>
       </li>
    <li class="right">
    <h5>Write a script</h5>
     <p><img src="static/ib/step03_writetheRules.png" class="right"> Once learners have discussed overarching plans for how they will explain the idea, tell them to write a script so they know exactly what they want to say. Writing a script will help them plan the rest of the newscast by giving them a focal point. If they know what they want to say, they'll be able to find images, tweets and popups to help illustrate their point.</p>
	 
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Make a plan</h5>
	    Learners should create a <a href="../CrashCourses/schematics.html">Storyboard</a> to help them outline the newscast. Have them think about what Popcorn events they will use to explain their idea. Find images and links on the web that help with this explanation.
    </li>
    <li class="right"><img src="static/hh/step04_popcorn.png" alt="popcorn" class="right">
      <p>Now, learners follow the steps in the Webmaker project "<a href="https://www.webmaker.org/en-US/projects/newscast/" target="_blank">Make a Newscast from your Bedroom</a>" to put their newscasts together.</p>

    <h1>Discussion</h1>
    <h5>Show peers your newscast, then make it better!</h5>
   <p> Have learners ask their peers what <em>they</em> think the idea is. Everyone should help each other by giving feedback and improving things that made ideas hard to understand. Provide individual constructive feedback during presentations.</p>

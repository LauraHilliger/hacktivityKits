      <h1>E.A.K. Code Game</h1>
      <h2>E.A.K. (Erase All Kittens) is an open source platform game that teaches kids to code and create on the web, using HTML and CSS.</h2>

	      <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>E.A.K. teaches code using 'stealth learning' - our goal is to provide learners with their first steps towards digital literacy in the most entertaining way possible. By changing the source code of the levels - written in HTML and CSS, just like a web page - players must rescue kittens to complete the game. E.A.K. is available to play online at <a href="http://eraseallkittens.com/">eraseallkittens.com</a>. Read more on <a href="https://blog.webmaker.org/community-literacies-4">the Webmaker blog</a>.</p>
        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
        <ul class="well blue">
	        <li>Combine an opening tag and its corresponding closing tag</li>
	        <li>Identify text between &lt;p&gt; tags</li>
	        <li>Copy and paste boxes using the &lt;div&gt; tag</li>
	        <li>Identify the various header tags</li>
	        <li>Use appropriate header tags in context of the game</li>
	        <li>Navigate game levels and follow keying directions</li>

          <h2>Steps for the Activity</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Get everyone to visit <a href="http://eraseallkittens.com/">eraseallkittens.com</a>. Click 'Play the Demo' to start the game.
              </p>
              <div class="well">
                Watching the video is best done as a group. The rest of the game can be played in pairs or as individuals.
              </div>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-mpBWdW0AAQE6L.jpg:large" alt="photo by erase all kittens"> In <strong>the tutorial level</strong>, use the <i class="fa fa-caret-square-o-left"></i> left and right <i class="fa fa-caret-square-o-right"></i> arrow keys to move, and press the spacebar to jump over the obstacle. Move over the box to release a kitten gif, and press the down arrow key when you are in front of the portal. This will lead you to the first code level. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The <strong>forest level</strong> involves learning how to <strong>edit simple code</strong> to make the ledge you are standing on longer. If you try jumping to the ledge on the right, you will miss it and fall. You’ll reappear, and a message will pop up, telling you to <strong>click 'Edit', or press the 'E' key</strong>.</p>
              <p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BqK8sftCMAEmmsE.jpg" alt="photo by erase all kittens"> After doing this, you’ll see a box with text appear. The initial text explains that the sentence below (with the coloured text) is the source code for the ledge you are standing on. <strong>Click in between 'Woohoo!' and the blue p tag</strong>, and start typing any letters on your keyboard eg. 'I'm a ledge that's getting bigger!'. When the ledge is long enough, <strong>click 'Save'</strong> in the top right-hand corner of the edit box. Run over to the kitten and portal and complete the level.
	              
              </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <p>In the <strong>space level</strong>, learners <strong>create new elements</strong> by copying the pattern of existing ones. Once again, you'll need to click 'Edit' or press 'E' to change the code. <strong>Copy the pattern of the two div tags</strong> to add enough boxes to reach the kitten and portal. <strong>Press 'Save'</strong>, and complete the level.
              </p>
            </li>

                The <strong>cave level</strong> involves learning how to <strong>create headings</strong>, by following the pattern for previous headings. If you try jumping down to the next ledge, and then jumping off it, you’ll die, then reappear in the same place. <strong>Type out the code for some extra headings</strong>, using the ones above as a reference. Change the numbers so they are consecutive eg. <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> for the third heading, <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> for the fourth heading etc. keeping the rest of the code consistent. You'll need to <strong>create 3 or 4 new headings</strong>, but remember that they only go up to 6: it won't let you add a <code>&lt;h7&gt;</code>. Don't forget to end each tag with a <code>/</code>! After saving, you might find you need to edit again to tweak the length of the ledges. <strong>Watch out for spikes!</strong>
              </p>
              
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                At the end of the game, you’ll see a questionnaire - it would be really helpful if everyone filled this out, so we can use your feedback to improve the game.

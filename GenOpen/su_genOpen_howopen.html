    <!--An icebreaker is an activity that gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own! -->
    <h3>Diving In</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Learners look closely at the ideas behind log in functions and open content. Through analyzation and inquiry, they will start to understand who owns certain aspects of their personal data and why that is important.</strong><br/>

      <p>Next, create two columns on the wall. One that says “Open”, one that says “Closed”. Explain that if the juicy content lives behind a login function (i.e. you have to be logged in to fully enjoy the site), the post it goes in the “closed” column, if there is no log in or if log in is only required for posting or editing, the site goes in the “open” column. </p>

    <li><img src="static/ib/step03_writetheRules.png" alt="step03_writetheRules" width="155" height="118">
      <p>Have learners place their post-its into one of the two columns. Have learners write down a list of differences between one website in the “closed” column and one in the “open” column. Which column has more post-its in it?</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right">
      <p>Have learners record the hacktivity outcomes in a Thimble page. They can <a href="https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/ftrb/edit">start from scratch</a>, or use this <a href="https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/ftrb/edit">handy template</a> to create their lists. Divide the post-its up into several groups and then have learners work together to create lists of websites using Thimble. Ask them to include their definitions of what an open webpage is vs what a closed content garden is.</p>

    <h1>Discussion</h1>
   <p>Talk about the hacktivity and the difference between the open web and closed gardens of content. Why do log ins exist? What kind of information should be behind log ins? What kind of information IS behind logins? What function do user accounts serve? When are they necessary? When are they not necessary? Have learners pair up or get into small groups. Explain that open sites are free from copyright restrictions or are publicly licensed for anyone to use, adapt, and redistribute the content found within. Talk about who owns what content on popular sites, and open a discussion about the relationship between freely accessible content and user log in.</p> </div>

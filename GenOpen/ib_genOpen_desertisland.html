    <!--An icebreaker is an activity that gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own! -->
    <h3>Icebreaker</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Using a theoretical situation and a lot of post it notes, learners explore the make up of their favorite websites.</strong><br/>

    <li> <img src="static/ib/step01_writetheRules.png" alt="step01_writetheRules" width="135" height="145"><p>Have learners think about the 3 websites they wouldn't be able to live without if they were stranded on a desert island. Tell them that these 3 sites are available in an offline cache, so the way they are today, is the way they will be for all time.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right"> <img src="static/ib/step03_writetheRules.png" alt="step02_writetheRules" width="135" height="100" class="right">
      <p>Ask each learner to write his or her sites on three separate post it notes. Next, explain that you'll be looking for the similarities and differences, so each learner should stick his/her post it notes on a wall.</p>
    </li>
    <li><img src="static/postitwall.png" alt="spostit wall" width="155">
      <p>Once all the post it notes are up, explain that they'll be categorizing the post-its. Have learners create their own categories, and place the websites into each category. Ask them to put any duplicate websites into one single category (e.g. If multiple students wrote “Facebook”, all the post its should be located in the same category)..</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right"><img src="static/ib/step04_writetheRules.png" alt="step04_writetheRules" width="135" height="103" class="right">
      <p>Review the categories, and talk about the sites people chose. Allow learners to rearrange the post its during the discussion. What do these sites have in common and how are they different? What do the categories say about the group?</p>

    <h1>Discussion</h1>
   <p>Talk about the wall of notes and ask questions to stimulate a discussion. Will the sites chosen become boring within a day, a month, a year? Will the fact that the sites are never updated with new content affect choices? Which sites require other people posting content to be interesting?</p> </div>

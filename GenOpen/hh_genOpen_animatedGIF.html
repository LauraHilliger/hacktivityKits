    <!--A Hands on Hacking activity is a practical activity that allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session. Go back to thinking of the results: what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Create a project that gives learners enough time to explore and tinker while working towards the completion of the activity.-->
    <h3>Hands on Hacking</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Through the creation of an animated GIF, you will be able to express your answer to the Generation Open question: <strong>If you could make anything on the Web, what would it be and why?</strong><br/>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li> <img src="static/step01_group.png" alt="step01_group" style="margin-bottom:45px;">
       <p>Compare and contrast the <a href="ib_genOpen_brainstorm.html">mindmaps from the first Hacktivity</a> to zero in on an idea for the entire group. How do the different ideas tie together? What do they have in common? You may need to create a new mindmap if there are many different ideas! Decide on the idea you would like to make GIF Animations for. Or, you can all make a GIF for your own idea!</li>
    <li class="right">
      <h5>Introduce the design challenge:</h5>
     <p>Try to answer the questions: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the most basic aspect of my idea? Is it a web app? A game? A website? A communication tool? What is the *thing* I would make on the web?</li>
        <li>Who is it for?</li>
        <li>What problem or issue is it addressing?</li>
        <li>What would it <em>do</em> to address this problem or issue?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     <h5>Plan your GIF</h5>
     <p>Create a <a href="../CrashCourses/schematics.html">Storyboard</a> to help you tell the story of your idea in this medium. Once you know what kind of imagery you want to use, decide how those images will animate. Will it be a simple slideshow that flips through a single image for each question, or will each question have multiple images. <strong>The GIF can be as simple or as complex as you want!</strong> Complex GIFs might take a bit more time, but you can tell very complicated stories in this medium.</p>

    <!--An icebreaker is an activity that gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own! -->
    <h3>Icebreaker</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Mindmapping is a great way to record ideas, outline concepts and show thought progression. You will brainstorm by creating Mindmaps for your ideas in response to the Generation Open question: <strong>If you could make anything on the Web, what would it be and why?</strong><br/>

    <li> <img src="static/ib/step01_writetheRules.png" alt="step01_writetheRules" width="135" height="145"><p>Create small groups and write the question in the middle of a large sheet of paper.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right"> <img src="static/ib/step02_writetheRules.png" alt="step02_writetheRules" width="135" height="100" class="right">
      <p>Each member of the group should write down 3 to 5 ideas, no matter how random, related to the question. Try to think about what problem you might want to solve and how the Web might help. Don't worry if your ideas seem far-fetched.</p>
    </li>
    <li><img src="static/ib/step03_writetheRules.png" alt="step03_writetheRules" width="155" height="118">
      <p>Generate statements, drawings, and words that expand upon each idea. Expand on your own ideas and on teammate's ideas. Work together to discuss what you would make if you could make anything on the Web and why you would make it.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right"><img src="static/ib/step04_writetheRules.png" alt="step04_writetheRules" width="135" height="103" class="right">
      <p>Finally, present your mindmaps to the rest of the groups. Talk about your processes and discuss new ideas that arose from the activity. Gather feedback from your peers.</p>

   <p>Discuss the process of the hacktivity and talk about the fact that brainstorming in collaboration can lead to new ideas. How did the hacktivity illustrate this? Who came up with a new idea because of what someone else wrote or drew?</p> </div>

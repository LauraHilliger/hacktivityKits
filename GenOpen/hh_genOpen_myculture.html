    <!--A Hands on Hacking activity is a practical activity that allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session. Go back to thinking of the results: what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Create a project that gives learners enough time to explore and tinker while working towards the completion of the activity.-->
    <h3>Hands on Hacking</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Learners showcase the musical culture in their local areas while collaborating with worldwide participants to make a multi-cultural promotional video.</strong><br/>

    <li> <img src="static/ib/step02_writetheRules.png" alt="small groups" style="margin-bottom:45px;">
      <p>Collectively explore problems and strengths of the open web. What would your life be like without the web? Who made the web? How can you tell the web was made by people? Who can contribute to the web?</p>
      <p>Introduce the concept and tenets of the open web:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anyone can use it to make things. (hackability)</li>
        <li>Transparent, you can see how it is made. (transparency)</li>
        <li>It doesn’t break because it is not “owned”. (decentralized)</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Introduce the Design Challenge:</h5>
      <p><img src="static/ib/step03_writetheRules.png" class="right"> A travel agency has hired you to go on a tour around the World and create a trip package for their clients. But their clients are only interested in visiting open communities that love music. You will  work with others around the world to create a travel webpage and promotional video that showcases the music and culture of a variety of open communities. Find examples of open content that helps you tell the story of your culture.</p>
      <h5>Your promotional video should have 4 parts:</h5>
      <a href="http://soundcloud.com"><img src="https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1690665610/big_avatar.png" width="124" class="right two"></a><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net"><img src="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/images/Audacity-logo-r_50pct.jpg" width="124px" class="right"></a>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>a media piece</strong> – You can take a piece of media or a video from the web, or you can create your own! Either way, take your time and find just the right piece of media to showcase the musical taste of your community.</li>
        <li>Perhaps you find the right musical track separately from your video. With Popcorn Maker you can turn the audio OR the video feed of a piece on or off. Additionally, you can add audio files, so you can record your own text and upload the audio file to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/upload">Soundcloud</a>. If you need a software to record and edit audio files, try <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>. If you need help using Audacity, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=record+with+audacity&oq=record+with+audacity&gs_l=youtube-reduced.3..0j0i5l3.230.2715.0.2843.20.12.0.0.0.0.362.1806.4j1j4j1.10.0...0.0...1ac.1.ub6C-AI_eWo">YouTube has lots of videos on the subject</a>.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>text and images</strong> –  Explain and illustrate the music and customs of your culture by adding dynamic content.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>a webpage</strong> – For the travel package webpage you'll need to create profiles for each community including descriptions or summaries, or even just a brief intro to your video.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><img src="static/hh/step04_popcorn.png" alt="popcorn" class="right">
      <p>Allow learners to create a plan for their videos using pens and paper. What assets will they collect? What images will they use? Invite them to draw sketches and plans of their videos.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right">
      <p>Have learners use the <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/projects/learn-html-fast-making-your-own-web-page/">Create Your Own HTML page</a> project to create their trip webpage. Allow them to collaborate to figure out tags, find mistakes and tinker around with HTML. Encourage them to add credits for the media they're creating.</p>

      <p><a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/MyCultureMyMusic">This Etherpad (https://etherpad.mozilla.org/MyCultureMyMusic)</a> collects the work of everyone doing this project.  To create your media, have learners find the most recent link and remix it. Allow groups of learners to create their own videos, then compile each piece into a single Popcorn Project. Finally, add your link to the bottom of the list! </p>

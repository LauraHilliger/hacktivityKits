Welcome to the Webmaker Profile Template!

This page requires a unique blend of HTML agility, CSS wizardry and mental firepower. There are people who are on the web, and then there are people who MAKE the web. Your goal in this project is to MAKE your very own Webmaker profile page. Add images, links and content to this page to create your very own profile page and share what you are passionate about teaching and learning.
============================================================================ --><!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

Everything contained within this <style> tag is called CSS and it is used to define the presentational components of the page, like fonts, colors, containers, positioning, etc. Remember that in CSS, comments are enclosed in '/*'. You can edit this CSS.

  body { font-family:Open Sans, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif;width:1000px;margin:0 auto; }

  <!--
Now share a few things about yourself such as things that you love to do, want to make or links from projects that you have already worked on. The <ul> tag is used for bulleted, or unordered lists (versus <ol> for ordered lists). Each <li> tag is a separate list item, or bullet. You can change the text between each <li> tag. You can even try making this an ordered list (Hint: <ol> instead of <ul> and remember to close the tag!)

You can also link out to projects you've done or sites you love by using the <a> tag which is used for hyperlinks. The <a> tag has a very important attribute: href, which defines the URL you want to point to. The text you put between the open <a> tag and the close </a> tag will hyperlink the text that shows up on the page, linking to the URL you specify. Try it out!

You can change your tagline by changing the text within the <h1> tag. <h1> is used for headings - the "h" stands for header and the "1" stands for most important (versus h2, h3, etc.). Try a different headline for your avatar.

Congrats on completing your Webmaker profile page! You can still go back and change things - that's the beauty of the Web. You might have missed it, but you actually learned some stuff in this project. You now know how to do comments in HTML and CSS, manipulate some CSS, work with headers (the <h1> tag), use lists (<ul> and <ol>) and bullets (<li>), add hyperlinks to text (<a> tag) and even a little about Web safety and privacy. Way to go, Webmaker!

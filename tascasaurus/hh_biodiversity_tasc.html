    <!--A Hands on Hacking activity is a practical activity that allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session. Go back to thinking of the results: what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Create a project that gives learners enough time to explore and tinker while working towards the completion of the activity. See all Hands on Hacking Hacktivities at http://www.hivenyc.org/hacktivityGrid.html-->
    <h3>Hands on Hacking</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Participants are introduced to biodiversity. They examine and document local bio facts such as leaves, stones, and feathers, and use their documents and online research to begin a website about local (or broader) biodiversity. <br/>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
    <img src="static/leaves.png" alt="leaves" style="margin-bottom:45px;margin-right:45px;margin-top:30px;">
    <h5>Local biodiversity</h5>
    <p>Show one artifact (a leaf, a stone, a feather) and <strong>ask</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What is this?</li>
    <li>Where do you think I got it?</li>
    <li>Is it part of the natural world, or human-made?</li>
    <li>Living or non-living?</li>
    <p>Have learners name all the natural things they can think of in their neighborhood.</em> Have one learner chart the living things, and another the non-living. Note that "living' includes things that were alive at one time.</p>
    <p>If you think it's helpful, have them chart everything in their environment, and have three charts: natural living, natural non-living, and human made.</p>
    <p>Explain biodiversity. Ask whether they think there is high, medium, or low biodiversity in your area?</em></p>
    </li>
    <li class="right">
      <h5>Document local biodiversity, introduce picture uploading</h5>
      <p>Start by examining some biofacts from your area. Display your collection, and ask the learners to begin researching and documenting them. Encourage them to start by taking pictures or making drawings, so they can learn how to upload them for use on their websites.</p>
      <h5>As people complete their drawings/pictures</h5>
      <p>Have learners scan the drawings and download the photos as they create them OR use previously downloaded pictures of the objects. Help learners upload their images to <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>. Either have learners create an account or login to the account(s) already created for their use. Discuss the importance of controlling public access to their pictures, and ask everyone to make sure the account allows only private access.</p>
      <p>Tell them to click on "Upload Photos and Video." They can then either drag and drop or select pictures from a file. Have youth help each other if some are having difficulties.</p>
      <p>When ready, have them move their cursor over a newly uploaded image, right click, and select "copy image url". Tell them to complete the transfer as they have previously: open a webpage, turn on the goggles, and paste the new url over the old. Make sure everyone is able to do this, and engage youth in helping each other. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Create the Websites</h5>
      <p>Ask the learners to research and plan their biodiversity websites, beginning with their bio facts. Provide books and a list of websites for online research, but encourage them to search for additional sites.</p>
      <p>Suggest they use one of the following sites:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.queensmuseum.org/">Queens Museum of Art</a>: http://www.queensmuseum.org/</li>
        <li><a href="http://brooklynartscouncil.org">Brooklyn Arts Council</a>: http://brooklynartscouncil.org</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.prospectparkzoo.com">Prospect Park Zoo</a>:http://www.prospectparkzoo.com/</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: You may need to use more than one session to complete the research and websites.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right">
      <h5>Close out the Website</h5>
      <p>Find out where the students are with building their biodiversity websites. To save sites, hit the "publish to Internet" button. Open published sites in a new window, then copy the url in the address bar and save it somewhere. This is how learners can get back to this page and change it, or share it with friends.</p>
      <p>Ask if there are any questions or comments. Ask participants to raise their hands if they feel they could improve their sites in the next session.</p>

    <h1>Discussion</h1>
    <h5>Have participants talk about their biodiversity sites and display the work they have done.</h5>
    <p>Following the presentations, facilitators should direct participants to other resources in their community or online to learn more about hacking and web design/development. Provide individual constructive feedback during presentations. Ask students if they know what STEM means (science, technology, engineering, math). Is biodiversity a STEM topic? What other STEM fields do learners know about?</p>
    <p>Give students some STEM websites and ask them to list three STEM topics they'd like to create websites about. Ask them to explain why they are interested in those topics. </p>

    <!--A diving in activity is one that gives pointed instruction to participants on tools or procedures. An example of a diving in activity would be allowing the participants to get used to the interface of Thimble or Popcorn by having them make projects. Before learners can practically apply new skills, they need to be comfortable with the tools they'll be using and have a basic understanding of the skills they'll be sharpening. See all Diving In Hacktivities at http://www.webmaker.org/hacktivities#settingup -->
    <h3>Diving In</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>The goal of this hacktivity is for participants to create their first webpage by hacking and tinkering with an existing webpage.<br/>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li> <img src="static/su_goggles/step01_installGoggles.png" alt="step01_install" width="169" height="105">
      <p>If you haven’t already, install the Goggles <a href="http://hackasaurus.org/en-US/goggles/install/">here</a>. Tell participants that they will be hacking a website. Tell participants to open the <a href="http://gsg.org">Great Science for Girls website</a> (www.gsg.org) and activate their goggles. Tell them we are using this site because it uses mostly HTML, so is easy to practice on.
      
      <ul>
        <li> Have them move the cursor until they find an image. </li>
        <li>Click on the image so it expands and you can see the code.</li>
        <li>Say: Now open a new tab and search for an image of your favorite animal (e.g., enter "pictures of Koga the gorilla" in the search box).</li>
        <li>Right-click on one of the images, and then select "copy image url." (If that choice doesn't show up, choose another image.) </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="right"> <img src="static/su_goggles/step02_installGoggles.png" alt="step02_hover over objects" width="103" height="114" class="right">
      <p>Go back to Great Science for Girls. Remind learners you talked about the "Basic" and "Advanced" tabs? Click on the advanced tab. Say:
      
      <ul>
        <li>Do you see where it says &lt;img src=? After the equal sign, notice the quotation marks. What's inside of them? <em>(Something beginning with http and ending with .jpg, .png or .gif.)</em> </li>
        <li>That's the link to the image you see on the page, and that's what you are going to change. You need to keep the tags and the quotation marks, so make sure you highlight just the image url.</li>
        <li>Got it? Now right-click and select "paste". Has your image changed?</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> <img src="static/su_goggles/step03_installGoggles.png" alt="step03_remix" width="199" height="83">
      <p>If some learners are having problems, ask others to help trouble-shoot. Possible issues: they didn't select "copy image url"; they highlighted more than just the url (e.g.,they took out the quotes as well); they didn't select the entire url.</p>
      <p>As you and the kids work to solve the problems, reassure them that messing around and making mistakes is a great way to figure out how this works. </p>
    </li>

      <h5>Play with hacking code, images, and text</h5>
      <p>Tell youth to continue experimenting with changing text, pictures and code.
      
      <ul>
        <li>On the basic tab, you can only hack content—text and pictures. The advantage is that you won’t accidentally delete or change the code.</li>
        <li>However, try to deliberately change the code, using the advanced tab. Go ahead! What happens if you delete a closing tag? What happens if you substitute an “em” for a “strong”? Is the &lt;p&gt; tag really necessary?</li>
        <li>Have learners write down what they’ve tried and what happened so you can discuss. And if things get completely out of hand, just close the box and start over.</li>
        <li>Make sure you hack at least one image and one piece of text.</li>
        <li>Remember that this is a collaborative hacktivity. It’s okay to give help and need help.</li>
        <li>If they are ready, tell youth they can hack links following a similar procedure as for pictures. In the code, locate the tag that indicates a link (&lt;a href=”http:websiteurl”&gt;descriptivetext&lt;/a&gt;) and replace the url with another. You can also change the descriptive text. </li>
      </ul>

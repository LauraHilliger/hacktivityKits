    <!--A Hands on Hacking activity is a practical activity that allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session. Go back to thinking of the results: what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Create a project that gives learners enough time to explore and tinker while working towards the completion of the activity. See all Hands on Hacking Hacktivities at-->
    <h3>Hands on Hacking</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Learners create or find a radio recording and make it mass accessible by adding Popcorn events to it.<br/>

  <ol>
    <li> <img src="../static/ib_popcorn/step03_writetheRules.png" alt="compose a poem" width="155" height="118">
      <p>Have learners compose an audio recording as if it were being broadcast on the radio. It might be a short poem, a funny story or a short interview.</p>
      <p>Depending on your other learning objectives, you may wish to have learners critically examine or comment on a pre-recorded audio piece. <a href="http://soundcloud.com/storycorps" target="_blank">Storycorps</a> has excellent oral history recordings or you might choose to have learners find a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/search?q=spoken%20word">Spoken Word</a> piece.</p>
      </li>

      <h5>Introduce the design challenge:</h5> <a href="http://soundcloud.com"><img src="https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1690665610/big_avatar.png" width="124" class="right two"></a><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net"><img src="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/images/Audacity-logo-r_50pct.jpg" width="124px" class="right"></a>
      <p>Design Challenge: How does imagery influence the way someone hears or reads a piece of text? Now that you've composed a poem, narrative or other piece for an audio recording, you'll find web content and images to illustrate your point. If you haven't already, record your text and upload the audio file to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/upload">Soundcloud</a>. If you need a software to record and edit audio files, try <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>. If you need help using Audacity, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=record+with+audacity&oq=record+with+audacity&gs_l=youtube-reduced.3..0j0i5l3.230.2715.0.2843.20.12.0.0.0.0.362.1806.4j1j4j1.10.0...0.0...1ac.1.ub6C-AI_eWo">YouTube has lots of videos on the subject</a>.</p>
      <p>Allow learners to create a plan for their videos using pens and paper. What assets will they collect? What images will they use? Invite them to draw sketches and plans of their videos.</p>
    </li>
    <li><img src="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/thumbnail-stopandfrisk.png" alt="stopandfrisk" width="120">
      <p>Have learners remix the <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/templates/basic/?savedDataUrl=projects/stop-and-frisk.json">Radio Rookies Stop and Frisk project</a> using Popcorn Maker to put their poems and assets together. Learners should swap the Media Source out with their uploaded Soundcloud files. Tell them to use events to illustrate their ideas on their topics.</p>

    <h5>Have participants talk about their films and display the work they have done.</h5>
    <p>Following the presentations, facilitators should direct participants to other resources in their community or online to learn more about filmmaking and remixing. Talk about changing the context of something by adding additional information. Provide individual constructive feedback during presentations.</p>

    <!--A Hands on Hacking activity is a practical activity that allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session. Go back to thinking of the results: what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Create a project that gives learners enough time to explore and tinker while working towards the completion of the activity. See all Hands on Hacking Hacktivities at-->
    <h3>Hands on Hacking</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Learners create a video in their local neighborhood, then use Popcorn to add descriptions and detail.<br/>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li> <img src="../static/step01_group.png" alt="group discussion">
      <p>Have learners think about community issues in their neighborhoods. Ask the question, "What is the biggest issue in your neighborhood?" and guide a discussion wherein learners can express their thoughts about local issues.</p>
      </li>
    <li class="right">
      <h5>Introduce the design challenge:</h5> 
      <p>Design Challenge: </p>
      <p>Every neighborhood has different issues that affect its community. In one neighborhood it might be a run down building that mars the aesthetic, while in another neighborhood homelessness might be prevalent. There are also stories in which citizens have changed their neighborhoods through collaborative actions, such as creating a community garden or organizing a neighborhood art festival. Find a story that is unique to your neighborhood and create a segment that covers that story.</p>   
      <p>Allow learners to create a plan for their videos using pens and paper. How will they tell their story? What assets will they collect? What images will they use? What is the sequencing for the story? Invite them to draw sketches and plans for their videos.</p>
    </li>
    <li><img src="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/thumbnail-tour.png" alt="neighborhood tour" width="120">
      <p>Have learners film short segments in their neighborhoods. Even a film shot with a cellphone can work for this project. If time (or equipment) is a factor, invite them to make an audio recording of their stories and pull images and content from the web to illustrate it. Learners can upload the audio file to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/upload">Soundcloud</a>. If you need a software to record audio files, try <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>. If you need help using Audacity, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=record+with+audacity&oq=record+with+audacity&gs_l=youtube-reduced.3..0j0i5l3.230.2715.0.2843.20.12.0.0.0.0.362.1806.4j1j4j1.10.0...0.0...1ac.1.ub6C-AI_eWo">YouTube has lots of videos on the subject</a>. </p>

      <p>Have learners remix the <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/templates/basic/?savedDataUrl=tour.json">Neighborhood Tour</a> project to be about their own neighborhoods. Once everyone is finished, have learners present their videos and give each other feedback.</p>

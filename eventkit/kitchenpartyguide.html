Welcome to the Webmaker How to Run a Kitchen Party Guide!

Once you've run your Kitchen Party, you can remix this page to document your event! Swap out images and text and make this page your own.

This page requires a unique blend of HTML agility, CSS wizardry and mental firepower. There are people who are on the web, and then there are people who MAKE the web. Your goal in this project is to MAKE your very own Webmaker Event Documentation page. Add images, links and content to this page to explain your event and help others teach the web.
============================================================================ --><!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

Now share a few things about yourself such as things that you love to do, want to make or links from projects that you have already worked on. The <ul> tag is used for bulleted, or unordered lists (versus <ol> for ordered lists). Each <li> tag is a separate list item, or bullet. You can change the text between each <li> tag. You can even try making this an ordered list (Hint: <ol> instead of <ul> and remember to close the tag!)

You can also link out to projects you've done or sites you love by using the <a> tag which is used for hyperlinks. The <a> tag has a very important attribute: href, which defines the URL you want to point to. The text you put between the open <a> tag and the close </a> tag will hyperlink the text that shows up on the page, linking to the URL you specify. Try it out!

      <h3>1. Gather friends and family </h3>
      <img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7252/7788366626_49429ac4d5.jpg" width="424">
      <p> Find a cozy space to work like your kitchen, living room or perhaps a nearby coffee shop. Make sure you have Internet access and power for your computer. 
        <!-- Include your own pictures and descriptions. Share links to what you made!--> 
      </p>
      <h3>2. Start making</h3>

      <p>Warm up with a beginner activity, such as <a href="http://hivenyc.org/GogglesPrototype/su_hacktheweb_goggles.html">Remix Websites with the X-Ray Goggles:</a> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recommended time: 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Visit your favorite website. Peek under the hood and see how it works. Remix the site and make it your own. Congratulations â€” you are now a hacker!</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3. Dive a little deeper</h3>
      <img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7121/7788305008_a950a49f73.jpg" width="424">

      <li>Recommended time: 15 minutes</li>
      <li>Make interactive videos by dragging and dropping content from the web (images, videos, tweets and more!). Learn about telling stories online.</li>
      <h3>5. Keep making!</h3>
      <img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8300/7788339274_5c23c39ab5.jpg" width="424">

Congrats on your kitchen party event documentation! You can still go back and change things - that's the beauty of the Web. You might have missed it, but you actually learned some stuff in this project. You now know how to do comments in HTML and CSS, manipulate some CSS, work with headers (the <h1> tag), use lists (<ul> and <ol>) and bullets (<li>), add hyperlinks to text (<a> tag) and even a little about open educational resources. Way to go, Webmaker!

Welcome to the How to Run a Hive Pop-Up Guide!

A Hive Pop-Up is an event format organized by members of a Hive Learning Network, or by groups who are exploring the possibility of forming a Hive Learning Network. It's kind of like a food court for learning, and this guide will help you design your own and springboard a Hive Learning Network in your own city.

Once you've run your Pop-Up, you can remix this page to document your event! Swap out images and text and make this page your own.

This page requires a unique blend of HTML agility, CSS wizardry and mental firepower. There are people who are on the web, and then there are people who MAKE the web. Your goal in this project is to MAKE your very own Webmaker Event Documentation page. Add images, links and content to this page to explain your event and help others teach the web.
============================================================================ --><!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

<!--
Now share a few things about your event such as where it was, who came, what you made or links from projects or pictures. The <ul> tag is used for bulleted, or unordered lists (versus <ol> for ordered lists). Each <li> tag is a separate list item, or bullet. You can change the text between each <li> tag. 

You can also link out to stuff your participants made with the <a> tag which is used for hyperlinks. The <a> tag has a very important attribute: href, which defines the URL you want to point to. The text you put between the open <a> tag and the close </a> tag will hyperlink the text that shows up on the page, linking to the URL you specify. Try it out!

  <!--Use this section to talk about your collaborators, how you planned, the venue you reserved, any issues you ran into before the event, etc.-->
  <h3>1. Before your event </h3>
  <img src="https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6214/6315286587_f0d30bb230.jpg" width="424">
  <h4>Contact local, like-minded organizations</h4>
  <p>Research organizations in your area that are interested in technology and learning. Ideally, participating organizations will believe in learning by making and will support out-of-school educational initiatives. Talk to staff about their interests, goals and the people they serve. Ask organizations to host a learning station â€“ a simple activity based on the work they do in the community. You can use a Hive Pop-Up to initiate the discussion of creating a Hive Learning Network in your city.</p>
  <h4>Plan Great Stations</h4>
  <img src="https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6049/6317817026_5f4fe8d460.jpg" width="424">
  <p>Work with the organizations to plan engaging stations. Stations should include fun, short games or activities that teach something about technology. Activities should be simple enough to explore in 5 minutes but have potential for expansion if participants show a particular interest. Participants should be able to easily float between stations, and they should be able to share what they create.</p>
  <p>Activities should be well-documented with photographs and video that can be shared online. Be sure to set aside time for organizations to see each other's activities and exchange ideas.</p>
  <h5>Sample Stations might include:</h5>
  <ul class="stations">
    <li><a href="http://hivenyc.org/GogglesPrototype/ib_boardgame_goggles.html"><img src="http://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/GogglesPrototype/static/ib_goggles/step03_boardgame.png" width="150px" style="float:left;padding-right:1em">Hack a Boardgame</a></li>
    <li>Reveal the mechanics of a game and break down the true definition of "hacking" in this fun, tinkering activity.	At the end, learners will understand that hacking is something that can be done in everyday life.</li>
    <li><a href="http://hivenyc.org/storycamp/week04/su_howto_thimble.html"><img src="http://stuff.webmaker.org/thumbnails/1_poster_keepcalm.jpg" width="100px" style="float:left;padding-right:.25em">Make your own How-to with Thimble</a></li>
    <li>Use HTML to remix and create a tutorial for anything!Help teach a bit of HTML and have learners publish and share their makes.</li>
    <li><a href="http://hivenyc.org/storycamp/week02/hh_radiointeractive_popcorn.html"><img src="http://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/storycamp/static/ib_popcorn/step03_writetheRules.png" width="150px" style="float:left;padding-right:1em">Make it Interactive: Bring a Radio Story to Life</a></li>
    <li>Use Popcorn Maker to explore how imagery influences the way someone hears or reads a piece of text. Use this fun, collaborative activity as a way to document your event!</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.printcraft.org/"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8405/8685688223_9db1d993f4.jpg" width="150px" style="float:left;padding-right:1em">3D Printing from Minecraft</a></li>
    <li>Login to Printcraft's Minecraft server to build Minecraft objects that you can then export and print on a 3D printer! Learners will understand how 3D modeling works and have an artifact to take home with them.</li>
    <li><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Scratch-1.jpg" width="150px" style="float:left;padding-right:1em">Make a Scratch game</a></li>
    <li>Teach the basics of computational thinking and programming by helping learners make a game using MIT Media Labâ€™s Scratch.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Pick a date and location</h4>
  <img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8521/8523367667_c5738f0a76.jpg" width="424">
  <p>Give yourself plenty of time and collaborate to make sure the date works for the participating organizations. Find a comfortable, flexible space. You'll need tables for each station and room to move around. Be creative â€“ maybe try a cafe, library or a hackerspace? Ensure there is Internet, power and good lighting. And don't forget snacks!</p>
  <h4>Spread the Word</h4>
  <img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8341/8175620194_9eaa621550.jpg" width="424"> 
  <!--Include links to your event invitation, webpages and social media callouts!-->
  <p> Give yourself enough time to promote your event. Consider making an <a href="#">event invitation</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/mozteach">spreading the word</a> to local communities. Share the link widely and ask the participating organizations to invite their communities. Also make sure to get plenty of extra volunteers to help run the event. You'll need people to help with set up and tear down, document and photographing the event, interact with parents, set up food, run station activities, etc.</p>

<h3>2. During your event</h3>
<!--Replace these images with pictures from your event.--> 
<img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8290/7727125088_f48d8203fc.jpg" width="424"> 
<!--Use this space to talk about the people who came to your event-->
<h4>Before learners arrive</h4>
<p>Set up tables in a large circle. Use posters or other signage to indicate the different stations. Remind facilitators to welcome newcomers, and make sure the volunteers know what their jobs are and what stations they're at.</p>
<h4>Get people started</h4>
<img src="https://photos-4.dropbox.com/t/0/AADjK9uImZLrl2puwSB4JM6YIELVVlhMwPEsEMRKFJ6sQA/12/143552469/jpeg/32x32/3/1371128400/0/2/6907855325_d53ac350bc_b.jpg/ijUaVSaP8Wl0t_eaC2vF_8WHMnM0wzQiHiP7VmNQmGA?size=1280x960" width="424">
<p>Welcome the group and invite each station to introduce their organization and what they'll be making. Encourage people to follow their interests by staying at stations as long as they like. </p>
<h4>Help learners engage</h4>
<img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8089/8523354027_bde7f7e8d5.jpg" width="424">
<p>During the event, help people find things to do, encourage people to move around freely and have fun!</p>
<h4>Share the hacks</h4>
<img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8055/8090421737_edb3285010.jpg" width="424">
<p>After an hour or two, bring the group into a circle. Celebrate what participants made. Invite a few people to share their work. Encourage the group to post their work online with the tag #makerparty.</p>
<p>Ask participants for feedback. What did they learn? What did they enjoy? If they have suggestions for improvement, be sure to take notes or invite them to blog about it. Be sure to ask what the participants would like to do next. Provide links to websites where they can continue learning new skills.</p>
<p></p>

<!--What surprised you at your event? How did participants react to your different activities? What kind of discussions took place? What did your cooragnizers think about the experience? What would you do differently?-->
<h4>Wrap Up</h4>
<p>Once the public has gone, do a debrief with the participating organizations. Gather feedback and ask if the Pop-Up was a good way for them to serve their communities? Talk about continuing to hack together and establishing a Hive Learning Network. </p>
<h3>After your event</h3>
<h4>Communicate with Participating Organizations</h4>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/63LE390.png" width="424">
<p>Send a heartfelt "Thank you!" to participating organizations. Ask them to report on the Hive Pop-Up to their communities, and help them by providing photos, videos and links to the work that was created. Ask when these organizations might like to meet to continue the discussion of forming a Hive Learning Network.</p>
<h4>Inspire other webmakers and Hive Pop-Up hosts!</h4>
<p>You can hack this guide to create documentation for your event. Then post photos and makes to <a href="http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker">our G+ group</a> and share your documentation widely. Please <a href="mailto:mozparty@webmaker.org">email us</a> links to the things you made and your thoughts on the event. Join a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmakers/Community_Calls">Community Call</a> and talk about your Pop-Up.</p>

<!-- 
Congrats on completing your event documentation! You can still go back and change things - that's the beauty of the Web. You might have missed it, but you actually learned some stuff in this project. You now know how to do comments in HTML and CSS, manipulate some CSS, work with headers (the <h1> tag), use lists (<ul> and <ol>) and bullets (<li>), add hyperlinks to text (<a> tag) and even a little about open educational resources. Way to go, Webmaker Mentor!

Welcome to the Hackable Facilitation Guide!

Use this template to write out an agenda for your Webmaker session and get tips on the hows and whys of group facilitation. Use the Hacking Guides for ideas on activities to run, or create your own Kit: https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-make-a-kit-template

This page requires a unique blend of HTML agility, CSS wizardry and mental firepower. There are people who are on the web, and then there are people who MAKE the web. Your goal in this project is to MAKE your very own Webmaker Agenda page. Add images, links and content to this page to create an Agenda and help others teach the web.
============================================================================ --><!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

    <h2>Workshop Title</h2>
    <h3><span class="subtitle">Template for 4 Hour Agenda</span></h3>
    <img src="http://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/images/greenbar.png">
    <h3>[25 mins] Introductions, Persona and Profiling</h3>
    <p>Start by introducing yourself and explaining what YOU want them to learn. Include links to the workshop <a href="http://etherpad.mozilla.org">etherpad</a> and explain that you're keeping a pad to stay connected, catalog links and share work. Ask questions to get an idea of who's there and peers that can pair up to help one another.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who can code?</li>
      <li>Who can teach?</li>
      <li>Who has experience with Webmaking tools specifically?</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Introductions</h4>
    <p>To keep introductions short, use a prompt that allows people to say a single unique thing. For example, "My name is, I work on/for/at, and if you really knew me, you'd know..."</p>
    <p>A Facilitator has to be willing to make a fool out of him/herself, so choose a game to loosen people up and be animated in the way you  begin. People are self conscious, show them that you see everyone as 100% awesome. Try to remain positive the entire time. When you have "problem people" be firm, but nice, and remember you're the workshop leader.</p>
    <h4>Persona and the Badge Backback</h4>
    <p>Get everyone to set up <a href="http://login.persona.org">Persona</a> and their <a href="https://backpack.openbadges.org/backpack/login">Badge Backpack</a></p>
    <h4>Profiling</h4>
    <p>Have participants draw themselves and label the drawing with one word that they self identify as and their names. Add other information about themselves while eating.</p>
    <p>This exercise helps facilitators make associations between words, names and faces. Plus it helps you judge the personality-type that people have. If people feel like you're trying to know them, they LET you teach. EVERYONE likes hands on exercises ;)</p>
    <h3>[30 mins] ***FOOD***</h3>
    <p>Feed people. Or at least give them coffee. It's good to give people a topic to talk about while they're eating.</p>
    <!--An introductory activity gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own!-->
    <h3>[15 mins] Icebreaker Activity</h3>
    <p>Use a hacktivity (like the <a href="http://hivenyc.org/PopcornPrototype/ib_spectrogram_popcorn.html">Spectrogram</a>) that introduces the topic for the day. This puts participants in a particular mind frame and prepares them for learning.</p>
    <!--Hack the below statements to run your own Spectrogram, or replace this activity with something else. There's a list of activities at http://hivenyc.org/hacktivityGrid.html -->
    <ul>
      <li>Anyone who writes in this day and age, is writing for the web.</li>
      <li>It's important that everyone learn basic HTML and CSS.</li>
      <li>This is another set of tools to do excellent journalism.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>[10 mins] Break into Groups</h3>
    <p>No one has to work alone. They will work independently, but with peers. Oh, sounds impossible? No, participants get to ask the person next to them for help instead of raising your hand. This isn't elementary school! Explain that you'll be floating and help people that get stuck. Tell people to work with people they don't know! </p>
    <h3>[30 mins] MAKE</h3>
    <!--There's a list of activities at http://hivenyc.org/hacktivityGrid.html or you can write up one of your own using the Hackable Activity Template: https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-activity-template -->
    <p>A good second activity is one that gives pointed instruction to participants on tools or procedures. An example would be allowing the participants to get used to the interface of Thimble or Popcorn by having them make projects. Before learners can practically apply new skills, they need to be comfortable with the tools they'll be using and have a basic understanding of the skills they'll be sharpening.</p>
    <p>You float. Be sure to point people to additional resources, websites or cheatsheets! </p>

    <h3>[20 mins] Who are we and why are we working together? (+Q&amp;A) </h3>
    <p>Recircle and give people context about you or your organization. Never do this at the beginning of a session, but do it. By now they're interested to know where you came from (if you're doing your job right ;) </p>
    <!--For example, at this event called "Writing. Making. Sharing.", we introduced the people and organizations that helped organize: -->
    <h5>Writing. Making. Sharing. was a collaborative event created by:</h5>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <h3>[1hr 20 mins] MAKE</h3>
    <!--Write up your own activity with the Hackable Activity Template! https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/hackable-activity-template -->
    <p>Everyone forms groups and collaborate to do a third activity. A practical, project based activity allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session.</p>
    <!--This make session is about team work and composition. How do groups work out the design challenge? Advise that they can make multiple pages, but that they should set requirements and plan together. Each group plans, collects assets, builds.-->
    
    <h5>Break into small groups</h5>
    <ul>
      <li> In small teams, <strong>start brainstorming</strong> about the challenge and write down as many solution as possible. Rough notes and sketches are fine!</li>
      <li>Regroup for a few minutes and <strong>present the best ideas.</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_geeking">Try a Speedgeek format!</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Start Hacking</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Go back into teams</strong> and focus on the ideas that got the most traction. </li>
      <li>Start drafting the <strong>prototypes on paper</strong>. This helps formulate ideas and exposes any holes.</li>
      <li><strong>Consider design elements</strong> to simplify and improve the user's experience. </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Sprint to Finish</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep refining</strong> the paper prototype or using other techniques and tools, like <a href="https://thimble.webmaker.org">Thimble</a>, to get closer to a workable solution.</li>
      <li>Teams sprint to finish their <strong>"minimum viable prototype."</strong></li>
      <li>Each team prepares <strong>a short demo or presentation</strong> of their project.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>[30 min] Closing Circle</h3>
    <p>Use the closing circle to <strong>celebrate</strong> what you made. Have participants present their prototypes and encourage them to think about what they want to do next with their project.</p>
    <p>If you like, share your prototypes with the world! You can publish the links and other materials to a blog or the social network of your choice.</p>
    <p><strong>Please tag your work with #makerparty</strong></p>
    <p>You may also want to ask questions like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What did you make?</li>
      <li>What did you learn?</li>
      <li>Do you have questions?</li>
      <li>How would you like to follow up?</li>
      <li>Were you excited?</li>
      <li>Did you have fun?</li>
      <li>What will you do next?</li>
      <li>How would you change this workshop?</li>
    </ul>

Congrats on creating your Agenda! Once you've run your event, go back and edit the things that didn't work well, or comment further. Then, share your agenda so others can run an event like yours! 

You can always go back and change things - that's the beauty of the Web. You might have missed it, but you actually learned some stuff in this project. You now know how to do comments in HTML and CSS, manipulate some CSS, work with headers (the <h1> tag), use lists (<ul> and <ol>) and bullets (<li>), add hyperlinks to text (<a> tag) and even a little about open educational resources. Way to go, Webmaker!

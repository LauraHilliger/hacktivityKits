Someone started spraying a graffiti tip on this wall, but they didn't finish their sentence! They also didn't put the words in a single line. Finish the sentence and line the words up on the top of the page. 
========================================================================= -->

<!--

Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just 
text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, 
so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. 
The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. 
Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

/* Let's unpack this code: The first number is the horizontal offset and the second is the vertical offset. These two numbers designate how far away the shadow is from the letters. Negative numbers push the shadow to the left for horizontal offset and towards the top for vertical offset. The third number is the amount of blurring the shadow should have. Finally, there is a hexadecimal color code. If you use multiple definitions, you can create a great many different text effects. 

There are lots of interesting things you can do with the text-shadow property! Check out 12 cool effects here: http://designshack.net/articles/css/12-fun-css-text-shadows-you-can-copy-and-paste/ */

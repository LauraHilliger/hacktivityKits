Help Mozilla celebrate their 15th birthday by sharing your 15 favorite things about the web
============================================================================
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this HTML tag is not processed as code, but is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this: <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

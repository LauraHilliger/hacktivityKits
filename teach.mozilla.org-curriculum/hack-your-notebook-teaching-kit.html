        <p>Explore the rich connections between art, electronics, notebooking and systems thinking by hacking your notebook with power and LEDs. <a href="http://www.nexmap.org/">NEXMAP</a> and <a href="https://cv2.squarespace.com/">CV2</a> partnered with <a href="http://educatorinnovator.org/">Educator Innovator</a> to create this Hack Your Notebook Teaching Kit. The kit was tested as part of the <a href="http://www.makesummer.org/?ref=ei">Summer to Make, Play and Connect</a>, a <a href="http://www.macfound.org/">MacArthur Foundation</a>-sponsored initiative powered by the <a href="http://nwp.org">National Writing Project</a> and the <a hfref="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/">Mozilla Foundation</a>.

<!-- AGENDA --> 
        <h2>Agenda</h2>
        <ol class="agenda">
          <li><a href="https://chadsansing.makes.org/thimble/LTY3MjU5NTk2OA==/human-circuits">Human Circuits</a>: Participants introduce themselves and then get up into groups and make ‘human machines’ of singing series circuits and parallel circuits with switches.</li>

          <li>Discussion - Have participants share what they made with each other; gallery walks work well for this. Reflect on the experience. Ask participants to share what they learned about circuitry, making and their learning process. Invite them to talk about what their next project might be and what new features, functions and technologies they’d like to incorporate.</li>
          <li>Documentation: Invite participants to share their work with other notebook hackers via the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106297899247135466221">21st Century Notebooking Google+ community</a> and on social media using #TeachTheWeb.</li>

<!-- TAGS 
Help others know what skills and competencies your teaching kit helps teach by tagging it! You'll have the opportunity to add tags upon publish. If your kit teaches Web Skills, consider using the Web Literacy Standard to tag it! Here's a helpful resource: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-tag-webmaker-makes-web-literacy-map

<!-- WHAT YOU'LL MAKE TOGETHER -->		
        <h2>Together we'll make...</h2>
        <p>
          A notebook with a dedicated power supply, flexible power leads and light using copper tape and LED stickers. Customize your hacks to create a notebook as unique as you. Each activity adds a new circuit design technique to your toolbox, allowing you to create beautiful, interactive electronics that help you tell your story.
        </p>
<!-- =============================== -->
<!-- PREPARATION -->  
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>
          Gather your hacking materials. We have a list of core materials and recommended additional materials here.</p>
        
        <p>Book a space that comfortably seats the number of participants and gives them at least 2 square feet of workspace; more is better. We recommend arranging the room in small groups so everyone can work together; most participants will want to ask each other questions and look at each other’s work as they make. Prepare a few drawing prompts appropriate to your audience. Questions whose answers require the visualization of ideas work really well.</p>
        <p>Facilitators should run through all the activities themselves and review the common troubleshooting issues listed on the Activity Pages. There are a number of digital resources (videos and animated GIFs) that participants may find useful, so if possible, make these available via laptops or tablets.
        </p>

<!-- TIPS and TRICKS -->
        <section class="teach-list">
          <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Some people like to figure out things on their own while others feel more comfortable getting a walkthrough--and some people go back and forth. Accommodate both by having a demonstration station where participants can opt-in to a more scaffolded workshop experience.</li>
            <li>The Hack Your Notebook kits contain the basic supplies needed to get familiar with basic paper circuitry practices and create a powered notebook. Providing extra art and craft supplies can inspire participants and allow further personalization of their notebook hacks. We have a list of suggested <a href="http://www.nexmap.org/hack-your-notebook-day-kits">auxiliary materials</a>, but get creative and see what else you can come up with.</li>
            <li>Some people can find manipulating the copper tape tricky, especially folding corners. Practicing with strips of paper can help participants develop confidence in their manual skills.</li>

        Prior Knowledge
        ***************
        If might find it useful to complete the 'Gig Poster' or 'Movie Poster' project before attempting this project.
        

         What you'll Learn
        ******************
        - You'll be editing various text elements on both the front and back cover of the book.
        - You'll be switching out (and potentially positioning) background images.
        - You'll be changing colors and the opacity of an element behind some paragraph text using rgba colors.
        - You'll be tweaking some animation properties to change how the book flips.
        
        Tasks
        ******************
        TASK 1) Change the text throughout the HTML to personalise the book.
        TASK 2) Change how fast the book flips by changing the speed of the transition.
        TASK 3) Change the direction in which the book flips by changing the rotate value of the transition.
        TASK 4) Change the background images for both the front and back of the book.
        TASK 5) Change colors in the CSS so that text is readable on the new background images.
        TASK 6) Change the opacity in the CSS so that the blurb is easily readable.

          In 2014 the #teachtheweb team at Mozilla set out to design and initiate a comprehensive training program that could be easily remixed and reproduced and content to support any one who wanted to teach the web. They planned to run sprints to make content that aligned with the Web Literacy Standard and worked to co-design resources and agendas with communities worldwide.

            Their work inspired a swift moving educational and technological revolution. From Bratislava to Bangkok, schools, museums, universities and other cultural institutions are running #teachtheweb to level up skills of their employees and constituents.

            In this brilliant reflection, the #teachtheweb Team talks about the trials and tribulations that inevitably led to the time of Teach the Web. They show us how working in community can change the world, and how their often hilarious journey led them to entirely new pedagogical and technological models.

            *****************************************************
            CSS transition is a powerful property as it allows us to animate elements of a webpage.

            The first digit represents the duration of the animation (the 's' stands for seconds). Change the 1s to something like 3s to make the flip last 3 seconds instead of 1 second.
            The last digit is the 'delay' - if you change 0s to say '4s' the flip wont happen for 4 seconds. You'll have to change the numbers on each transition property...

            ...The reason it takes quite a few lines of code to achieve just one animation is because 'transition' is relatively new and different browsers are still working out to how to interpret and render the property. We include these 'vendor-prefixes' so that our site looks good in as many browsers as possible. -moz- is for Mozilla Firefox, -webkit- is for Google Chrome and Safari who use the Webkit rendering engine, -o- is for Opera etc.

            The CSS transform property is responsible for how the book flips when we hover over it. Try changing rotateY to rotateX or rotateZ and see what difference that makes to the book when you hover. You can also change the number of degrees if you like. Note that by changing these values you may not be able to see the back of the book.

        *****************************************************************************
        Both the .front and .back CSS selectors below have a 'background-image' property. Change the URL to images that you want on the front and back cover of your book. It's a good idea to use images from Flickr, as you can often get large photos which are big enough to fill the full cover without leaving any white-space.

        If the image isn't aligning where you want it to on the cover, you can use the 'background-position' property. Currently the both the front and back covers have the background positioned so that the cats are on show. The first value represents the x-axis, and the second value represents the y-axis. In this case, we only want to change the position of the x-axis, which is why the y-axis value is set to '0'.

        Try changing the values to change the position of the images. You can use px's or %'s in order to achieve your desired effect.

        *****************************************************************************
        The problem with changing background images is that sometimes the content on the top of the image becomes hard to read. Having nice images is nice but text should always be the most important thing on the page, and you should make it as easy to read as possible.

        If you need to change the color of the text use the 'color' property. The first h1 selector has the property already written down, but if you need to change the color of other elements such as the the author's name, simply add the color property to the selector and select your color.

        TASK 6) Change the opacity in the CSS so that the blurb is easily readable.
        *****************************************************************************
        Below is the CSS written to put a white box around the blurb on the back of the book. The background-color property specifies the color of this box. Instead of using the word 'white', the RGBa color model is used. The 'RGB' stands for 'red, green and blue'. The 'a' specifies the opacity. 

        The numbers range from 0 (black) to 255 (white). Change the three 255's below to 0's and the box will change to black. The last number ranges from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (opaque). Change this number to 1 for the box to be a solid color with no opacity.

        The difference between using the RGBa color model in conjuntion with a background property and simply using the 'opacity' property is that opacity effects the entire element, whereas the RGBa model only changes the background color. If we were to use opacity on this .blurb element the text would also be transparent, which would make the text harder to read.

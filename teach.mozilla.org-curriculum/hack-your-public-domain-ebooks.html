Welcome to the Webmaker Creating Goals Template!

Use this template to create learning objectives and goals for your Webmaker session. Then, use the Webmaker Activity Template: https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/lzs3/edit

This page requires a unique blend of HTML agility, CSS wizardry and mental firepower. There are people who are on the web, and then there are people who MAKE the web. Your goal in this project is to MAKE your very own Webmaker activity page. Add images, links and content to this page to create your very own activity page and help others teach the web.
============================================================================ --><!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.
--><html><head><meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Hack your (public domain) ebooks</title>
 
 <!--/* 
Everything contained within this <style> tag is called CSS and it is used to define the presentational components of the page, like fonts, colors, containers, positioning, etc. Remember that in CSS, comments are enclosed in '/*'. You can edit this CSS.

You can change the text within the different <h> tags. <h1> is used for headings - the "h" stands for header and the "1" stands for most important (versus h2, h3, etc.). Try different headlines for your activity.

    <h3>Draw the Big Picture</h3>

  	<!--What skills will your participants LEARN? Try making yourself a list, for example:-->
  <p>I want my participants (people who teach others) to learn that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ebooks are just mini-websites that can be easily edited.</li>
<li>HTML can be used to add content and CSS can be used to style existing or new content.</li>
  <li>There are lots of public domain resources on the web that can be freely augmented</li>
 
  <li>There are lots resources on the web for enhancing learning.</li>
  <li>You are only limited by your imagination.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>By the End of this Project</h3>
<!-- 
     What will your learners MAKE when they are done? How will they do that? What tools will they use? List these things out so other Webmaker Mentors can try out your kits!-->
     <p> My learners will customize their own (or public domain) ebooks using basic HTML and CSS tags. </p>
   <p>
We're going to use a variety of tools.</p>

  <h3>Activate Essential Questions</h3>
  <!--Activate Essential Questions that lead to deep understanding: what do you want your learners to be able to discuss and reflect upon?-->
  <p>My learners will be able to discuss and reflect upon:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the web made out of?</li>
    <li>How learning a little HTML &amp; CSS encourages creativity?</li>
    
    <li>What does "open web" mean?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With a little knowledge of HTML, CSS you can augment your own public domain ebook.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Summarize:</h3>
  <!--Summarize your goals and how your learners will reach them-->
  <p>By hacking ebooks my participants will learn about the open web, HTML and CSS.  They will have a better understanding of what resources are available to them and how they can be used creatively. 
 </p>
  <br>
<h3>Reference Projects</h3>
  <p><em>A project that takes this idea much further forward is <a href="http://solveforinteresting.com/book-as-api/">Book as API</a>.  See presentation by Hugh McGuire and Alistair Croll.</em>
  </p>
  
  <h3>More</h3>
  <p>Not only can participants hack their own ebooks, but they can develop similar projects for their students.</p>

Congrats on focusing in on your learning goals! You can still go back and change things - that's the beauty of the Web. You might have missed it, but you actually learned some stuff in this project. You now know how to do comments in HTML and CSS, manipulate some CSS, work with headers (the <h1> tag), use lists (<ul> and <ol>) and bullets (<li>), add hyperlinks to text (<a> tag) and even a little about open educational resources. Way to go, Webmaker!

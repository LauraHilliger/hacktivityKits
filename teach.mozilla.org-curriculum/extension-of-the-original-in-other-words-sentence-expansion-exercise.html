<!--Welcome to this "In Other Words" Thimble template for writers. "In Other Words" is a exercise in sentence expansion. Writers take a look at a vague or boring sentence and try to write a more specific and engaging sentence on the same topic using active verbs, figurative language, and rich modifiers.-->

<!--This is a comment formatted for HTML - you can tell by the brackets, their accompanying double-dashes, and the exclamation point after the first bracket. Whenever you write code, it's a good to leave comments that help users and other coders understand what's going on in your head and in the code.-->

<!--We're in the head of the page where coders put information about the page and instructions for how to show the stuff on it. After adding some basic information, we're going to use some external links and a stylesheet to position the elements of our page.-->

<title>Extension of the Original In Other Words Sentence Expansion Exercise</title>
<meta name="author">
<meta charset="utf-8">

<!--The page will have five main sections and a license. The sections will be a banner (for information like the number and date of the exercise), a background image, a box for the boring sentence (provided by you) a box for the new sentence (added by your student or colleague), and a box for a photo collage.-->

<!--I've found that exercises like this work best with an opportunity to share writing after its done (purely voluntary), heaps of praise for what works, and maybe just one constructive suggestion about something each contributing author can try next time. A kind and earnest micro-lesson delivered with humor in F2F conversation.-->

<!--You can edit the banner to keep track of which number you're on, and you can swap out boring sentences at will.-->

<!--Finally, if you'd like to contribute your prompts to an open educational resource, please visit this document - http://bit.ly/15CY2Zp -  and enter your name, a brief descriptor of your exercise (e.g. HDR sunset jungle picture), the date you added the exercise, and its URL. If ten of us did this half the school year, we'd have 900 writing prompts in no time.-->

<!--If you continue to remix in Thimble, your students and fellow writers can do the same, creating oodles of prompts in no time. You can also have your students or colleagues create portfolios or digital "writers' notebooks" of the work they save in Thimble by gathering the links to their exercises on another, shared webpage. Network the pages and your students or colleagues can see each other's work and riff on it through chained remixes - remixes of writers' products, not just of the assignments.-->

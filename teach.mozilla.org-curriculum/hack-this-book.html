            The <h1> is a heading tag and this is where you want to put your text for the poster.
            Try changing the text to something a little silly like "Keep Calm and Dance On".

       Struwwelpeter is a book designed to teach children certain life-lessons. Like don't play with matches or be respectful to your elders. It was written in 1861, and...

            TASK 2 - Understand how the <br /> tag works.
            ******************************************************
            Notice the <br /> tags in the heading?  These force a new line break (get it 'br' stands for 'break').  
            Try removing the <br /> tag in between the 'Keep Calm' text to see how they now sit on one line.

        The poster currently has a red background set on the <body> but there's nothing stopping you from changing it to another colour.
        You can use keywords for colours such as 'darkred', 'blue', 'green' etc, or for finer control you can HEX colours such as '#275a97'. 
        Try changing the background color from darkred to blue.

                    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                        <p><strong>[5 mins] Break into Groups</strong>. Group learners by the Webmaker tool they wish to use. You might also group them by subject matter. No one has to work alone! Try to keep your groups to 4 people or less, so that each participant has a chance to share their thoughts. Give each group paper, markers and pens. Make sure each group has at least one computer as well.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>[5 mins] Decide on the Learning Objectives</h3>

                        <p>Instruct learners to figure out which subject their group will create an open educational resource for. If you've grouped by subject matter, ask participants to agree on the tool they'll use.</p>

						<p><img src="http://s13.postimg.org/xbnm709cn/filledoutprototypes.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Have learners brainstorm a fun ways they might use the tool to present their subject matter. Have learners document their thinking on paper with <a href="https://laura.makes.org/thimble/collaborative-mindmapping">collaborative mindmapping</a> or another technique.</p>

                        <p>Have each group outline everything they'll need to create a digital artifact. Have them think about the images, videos and text they'll need to make.</p>

                        <p>Introduce the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a> and open content, and have groups collect openly licensed digital resources. Participants might find suitable pieces and parts at <a href="http://webmaker.org">Webmaker.org</a>, <a href="http://digitalis.nwp.org">DigitalIs</a> or <a href="http://p2pu.org">P2PU.org</a>.

                        <p>Have groups MAKE their ideas using one of the Webmaker tools. Float around to help learners that get stuck, and remind people that they can always go back and improve their project.</p>

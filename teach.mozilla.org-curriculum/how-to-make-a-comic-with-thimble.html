      <!--Introduce your Tutorial-->
      <h1>How to make a comic with Thimble</h1>
      <p>This is a quick and easy introduction to HTML and CSS as you make your own comic using Thimble. </p>
      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>In this project you can create your own comic strip using and square photos you have - so why not use the photos from your Instagram account?  You'll
    be able to add images, add copy in speech bubbles and captions.  You'll also learn how to make more scenes by adding more comic boxes.</p>
      <h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
      <p>What specific skills will participants learn? What new knowledge will they come away with? You might want to list these individually, like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changing images</li>
    <li>Changing text</li>
    <li>Changing classes</li>
    <li>Copying nodes</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <!--Explain your learning objectives-->
      <h1>Change some headers</h1>
      <p>First why not change the header &lt;h1&gt; to give your comic a better name.  Any text that goes inbetween the &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; tags will become the heading.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Understand the HTML structure</h1>
      <p>The &lt;div&gt; with the class 'comic' wraps around each comic 'scene' to contain them all.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h1>Swap images</h1>
      <p> Start by changing the images in the scene to one of your own photos. As the scene is square a square photo will work best. Why not get the image url of one of your Instagram photos?  </p>
     
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h1>Add Captions</h1>
      <p> Look at the 1st scene.  It has both a caption and a speech bubble. By copying the speech paragraph &lt;p&gt;,  try adding a speech bubble to the 2nd scene below and then change its text.</p>
     
    </section>
    
      <section>
      <h1>Reassign classes</h1>
        <p>Depending on the photo you use you might want to move the captions to either the 'top' or 'bottom', or the speech bubble either 'left or 'right'.</p> 
        <p>Look at the 4th scene.  It has a speech bubble on the left side. Change the class name 'left' to 'right' to make the speech bubble move to the right side.</p>
        <p>If you want a caption to be at the top make sure it has the class 'top', if you want it at the bottom makes sure it has the class 'bottom'.</p>
    
    </section>
    
     <section>
      <h1>Want to create a larger comic?</h1>
      <p>Copy the HTML for an entire 'scene' and paste it below the last scene...you now have 3 more scenes in your comic ;)</p>
    
    </section>
    
     <section>
      <h1>Congrats! You just made a comic!</h1>
      <p>Did you realize you were also learning a few things in the process? You actually learned a bunch about HTML structures. Plus, you know how to wrangle images in HTML as well.</p>

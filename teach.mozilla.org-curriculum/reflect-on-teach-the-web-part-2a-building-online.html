            <h3>What have you learned?</h3>

            <p>Reflecting on our experiences and creations leads us down the path to life-long learning. Write a blog post, make something to show your reflections or start a conversation with your peers. Make sure to share your reflections with the <a href="http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker">#teachtheweb community</a> (also on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=typd">Twitter</a>!).</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Add the Web to Anything</h3>

     <ul>
	<li>How can we create hacked resources that are easily remixable? What sort of tools can facilitate this?</li>
	<li>How can you adapt a resource and open it to your learners? How can you hack your learning space to inspire more open learning?</li>
	<li>How can you adapt/hack your practice into the open?</li>
	<li>Explore how hacking leads to learning. When hacking, what worked well? What didn't? and what did you learn from the latter?</li>
	<li>Why should we commit to adapting our teaching and learning to be the open?</li>
	<li>What are possible outcomes of educational systems that don't even know there is such a thing as programming (to borrow from Rushkoff) or as Arduinos or RPi or OER?</li>
	<li>What are possible outcomes of systems that do know about these things, and how do we work towards such systems/relationships/communities?</li>
	<li>What are the differences between different kinds of copyleft/open licenses? What else is there besides CC? How do these licenses deal with idea of openness and remix?</li>
	<li>How can we help learners demonstrate learning by remixing content in webmaking/coding frames so that they manipulate content rather than weather its delivery?</li>
</ul>

        <div class="alternate">
            <h3>Webmaking as Learning</h3>

            <ul>
            <li>How can we mix online and offline activities to get learners leveling up in the entire breadth of web literacy and open culture?</li>
	<li>How can we teach web skills in offline or slow network environments?</li>
	<li>What are best practices in making, coding and webmaking for teaching and learning?</li>
	<li>What are some common, helpful progressions or learning paths people take through webmaking?</li>
	<li>What are best practices for mentorship in online teaching communities? Which organizations or platforms get these right?</li>
	<li>What makes a space good for learning?</li>
	<li>How can remix invite learning?</li>
	<li>How do we bring collaborative digital making into a learning space?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Peers Working in the Open</h3>

        <ul>
           <li>What "best practice" forms of collaboration do connected learners and webmakers use?</li>
	<li>How can definitions of collaboration from informal learning spaces broaden collaboration in formal spaces?</li>
	<li>What are the barriers to collaboration in our spaces, and how do we help one another work around them to keep our teaching and learning open?</li>
	<li>How should we balance collaborative work with individual work?</li>
	<li>How does empathy play into collaboration?</li>
	<li>How does leadership play into collaboration?</li>
	<li>How do the following idioms relate to collaboration?
<ul>
	<li>“If you want something done right, do it yourself”</li>
	<li>"No man is an island."</li>
	<li>"There's no such thing as a free lunch."</li>
	<li>"Actions speak louder than words."</li>
	<li>"Too many cooks spoil the broth."</li>
	<li>"Two heads are better than one."</li>
	<li>"Honesty is the best policy."</li>
	<li>"A chain is only as strong as its weakest link."</li>
</ul>

    </div><!-- This is where the interesting stuff happens - the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). You can style each element that you've defined above. 

It's all pretty self-explanatory and, because you've got a preview window to the left and an undo button above, it's worth just tinkering around until you get what you want.

One final thing: if you click on an element (e.g. "iframe") a yellow question mark will pop up. Click on that and it'll take you to the Mozilla Developer Network where you can find out more about that element.

Have fun!

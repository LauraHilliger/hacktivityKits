          <h2>Steps for the Activity</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
		  	<h3>Introduce the ideas that <strong>Local Communities</strong>:</h3>
       
		  	<div class="example-div">
			  	<ul>
                	<li>can hold face-to-face events as a way to strengthen a community, and engender collaboration and dialog that sustain long after the first event is finished.</li>
					<li>are a way to provide individual professional and personal support for members and collaborators.</li>
					<li>can enable learning and support making and peer sharing. Community members should feel included and invited to bring questions and knowledge to share with the community as a whole.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>and the ideas that <strong>Global Communities</strong>:</h3>
       
		  	<div class="example-div">
			  	<ul>
                	<li>can amplify the work of your local community, when you share out what your local communities are doing in the global network.</li>
					<li>are a way to provide expert professional and personal advice for members and collaborators.</li>
					<li>can enable learning and support making and peer sharing. Community members should feel included and invited to bring questions and knowledge to share with the community as a whole.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
                
      </li>
          	

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Break into groups:</strong> Have groups collectively explore the points made in <a href="https://jessebade.makes.org/popcorn/1l75">this video</a>.</p>

                          <p>Have them remix the film to include information on how they would find connections based on what the interviewees are describing. What channels are they already using? Hash tags? How could someone connect online?</p>
                          <p>You might also have learners make a new film about their community or project. As an example, <a href="http://popcorn.webmadecontent.org/uur">here's a film</a> the Community Builders team at Mozilla made to help new community members navigate the Mozilla universe.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Start building! Have learners find video footage that can serve as the visuals for their new stories (try the <a href="http://archive.org/details/prelinger" target="_blank">Prelinger Archives</a> for archival video footage, or use <a href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>)</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Have learners use <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/" target="_blank">Popcorn Maker</a> to create an interactive video. Allow them to collaborate to figure out Popcorn Maker and tinker around with their own ideas.</p>

  Have participants talk about their films and display the work they have done. Following the presentations, facilitators should direct participants to other resources in their community or online to learn more about filmmaking, remixing and using video for engagement. Talk about changing the context of something by adding additional information. Provide individual constructive feedback during presentations.</p>

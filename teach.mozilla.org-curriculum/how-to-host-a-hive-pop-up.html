Welcome to the How to Run a Hive Pop-Up Guide!

A Hive Pop-Up is an event format organized by members of a Hive Learning Network, or by groups who are exploring the possibility of forming a Hive Learning Network. It's kind of like a food court for learning, and this guide will help you design your own and springboard a Hive Learning Network in your own city.

Once you've run your Pop-Up, you can remix this page to document your event! Swap out images and text and make this page your own.

This page requires a unique blend of HTML agility, CSS wizardry and mental firepower. There are people who are on the web, and then there are people who MAKE the web. Your goal in this project is to MAKE your very own Webmaker Event Documentation page. Add images, links and content to this page to explain your event and help others teach the web.
============================================================================ --><!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

Code comments like these will help with hints and guides.

Now share a few things about your event such as where it was, who came, what you made or links from projects or pictures. The <ul> tag is used for bulleted, or unordered lists (versus <ol> for ordered lists). Each <li> tag is a separate list item, or bullet. You can change the text between each <li> tag. 

You can also link out to stuff you made with the <a> tag which is used for hyperlinks. The <a> tag has a very important attribute: href, which defines the URL you want to point to. The text you put between the open <a> tag and the close </a> tag will hyperlink the text that shows up on the page, linking to the URL you specify. Try it out!

                            <p>Research organizations in your area that are interested in technology and learning. Ideally, participating organizations will believe in learning by making and will support out-of-school educational initiatives. Talk to staff about their interests, goals and the people they serve. Ask organizations to host a learning station – a simple activity based on the work they do in the community. You can use a Hive Pop-Up to initiate the discussion of creating a Hive Learning Network in your city.</p>

                            <p>Work with the organizations to plan engaging stations. Stations should include fun, short games or activities that teach something about technology. Activities should be simple enough to explore in 5 minutes but have potential for expansion if participants show a particular interest. Participants should be able to easily float between stations, and they should be able to share what they create.</p>

                            <p>Activities should be well-documented with photographs and video that can be shared online. Be sure to set aside time for organizations to see each other's activities and exchange ideas.</p>

                            <p>Sample Stations might include:</p>

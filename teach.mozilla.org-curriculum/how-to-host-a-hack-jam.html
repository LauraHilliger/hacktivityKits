Welcome to the Webmaker How to Run a Hack Jam Guide!

Once you've run your Hack Jam, you can remix this page to document your event! Swap out images and text and make this page your own.

This page requires a unique blend of HTML agility, CSS wizardry and mental firepower. There are people who are on the web, and then there are people who MAKE the web. Your goal in this project is to MAKE your very own Webmaker Event Documentation page. Add images, links and content to this page to explain your event and help others teach the web.
============================================================================ --><!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

Code comments like these will help with hints and guides.

Now share a few things about your event such as where it was, who came, what you made or links from projects or pictures. The <ul> tag is used for bulleted, or unordered lists (versus <ol> for ordered lists). Each <li> tag is a separate list item, or bullet. You can change the text between each <li> tag. 

You can also link out to stuff you made with the <a> tag which is used for hyperlinks. The <a> tag has a very important attribute: href, which defines the URL you want to point to. The text you put between the open <a> tag and the close </a> tag will hyperlink the text that shows up on the page, linking to the URL you specify. Try it out!

                            <p>Reserve a comfortable venue where you can move the chairs and sit together in a circle. Be creativeâ€”maybe try a cafe, library or a hackerspace?

                            <p>Welcome the group and invite them to introduce themselves. You can do a quick go-around in a circle and afterward try this fun icebreaker, the <a href="https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/how-to-run-a-spectrogram-icebreaker">Spectrogram</a>:</p>

                            <div class="example-div">

                            <p>Get everyone to set up <a href="http://login.persona.org">Persona</a> and their <a href="https://backpack.openbadges.org/backpack/login">Badge Backpack</a>. Set up note-taking using collaborative tools like <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/">etherpad</a>.</p>

                            <p>In small groups, brainstorm what you want to make. Consider who the target users of your project will be. Write out as many ideas as you want on post-its. Summarize each idea in simple language.</p>

                            <p>Invite everyone to post their ideas on a wall. Facilitate the group to cluster related posts. Discuss emerging trends and categories. Have people write their name next to projects they want to work on. You can do all of this and more with this <a href="https://laura.makes.org/thimble/mini-makers-scrum">Mini Maker Scrum Activity.</a></p>

                            <p>Form small groups based on the participants' chosen projects. Adjust group sizes as needed; 5 people or less is best. Float around to make sure each group is on track. You can guide them by remixing this activity to be relevant to your topics: <a href="https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/collaborative-mindmapping-finding-the-howto">Collaborative Mindmapping</a>.</p>

                                    <li>Write down all the requirements needed to build your idea. Then prioritize them, deciding on what pieces you could make today.</li>

                            <p>Prompt the groups to draw, write and code as much as they can. Don't let tech troubles distract you. Paper is just as useful for prototyping as code, and drawing just as fun. You can use activities like <a href="https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/remix-context-with-popcorn-maker">Remix Context with Popcorn Maker</a> to quickly develop ideas:</p>

                                    <li>Annotate online videos to tell an interactive story. Add web elements like images, audio, text and more to improve the project.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <p>Ask the groups to wrap up and prepare the room for presentations. Invite each group to share what they made. Reflect on the event, the projects and what everyone would like to do next.</p>

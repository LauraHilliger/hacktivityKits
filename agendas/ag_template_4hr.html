    <h3>What this page is</h3>
    <p><strong>Running a Webmaker event</strong> is half hacking a <a href="../kits.html" target="_blank">Hacktivity Kit</a> and half charisma, audacity and flexibility. This page is a sample agenda and guide for running a four hour participatory, collaborative workshop. It was built by remixing <a href="ag_opennews_4hr.html">this actual agenda.</a></p>

  <h1>Agenda</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>[25 mins] Introductions, Persona Set Up and Profiling</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Start by introducing yourself and explaining what YOU want them to learn. Include links to the workshop <a href="http://etherpad.mozilla.org">etherpad</a> and explain that you're keeping a pad to stay connected, catalog links and share work. Ask questions to get an idea of who's there and peers that can pair up to help one another.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Who can code?</li>
            <li>Who can teach?</li>
            <li>Who has experience with Webmaking tools specifically?</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Introductions</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>To keep introductions short, use a prompt that allows people to say a single unique thing. For example, "My name is, I work on/for/at, and if you really knew me, you'd know..."</li>
            <li>A Facilitator has to be willing to make a fool out of him/herself, so choose a game to loosen people up and be animated in the way you  begin. People are self conscious, show them that you see everyone as 100% awesome. Try to remain positive the entire time. When you have "problem people" be firm, but nice, and remember you're the workshop leader.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Persona and the Badge Backback</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Get everyone to set up <a href="http://login.persona.org">Persona</a> and their <a href="https://backpack.openbadges.org/backpack/login">Badge Backpack</a></li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Profiling</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Have participants draw themselves and label the drawing with one word that they self identify as and their names. Add other information about themselves while eating.</li>
            <li>This exercise helps facilitators make associations between words, names and faces. Plus it helps you judge the personality-type that people have. If people feel like you're trying to know them, they LET you teach. <strong>EVERYONE likes hands on exercises ;)</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>[30 mins ***FOOD***</h4>
          <p>Feed people. Or at least give them coffee. It's good to give people a topic to talk about while they're eating.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>[15 mins] Icebreaker</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Use a fun <a href="../hacktivityGrid.html#icebreaker">Icebreaker Hacktivity</a> (for example the <a href="../PopcornPrototype/ib_spectrogram_popcorn.html">Spectrogram</a>) that introduces the topic for the day. This puts participants in a participatory mind frame and prepares them for learning.
            </li>
          </ul>
            <li>
              <h4>[10 mins] Break into Groups</h4>
              <p>No one has to work alone. They will work independently, but with peers. Oh, sounds impossible? No, participants get to ask the person next to them for help instead of raising your hand. This isn't elementary school! Explain that you'll be floating and help people that get stuck. Tell people to work with people they don't know!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>[30 mins] Diving In</h4>
              <p>It's time to <strong>make stuff</strong>. Everyone starts doing a <a href="../hacktivityGrid.html#divingin">Diving In Hacktivity</a> (for example the <a href="../OpenNewsPrototype/su_remixthenews_thimble.html">Remix the News</a> Hacktivity). You float. Be sure to point people to any <a href="../crashCourses.html">Additional Resources</a> they might need.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>
          <h4>[20 mins] Who are we and why are we working together? (+Q&A)</h4>
        <li>Recircle and give people context about you or your organization. Never do this at the beginning of a session, but do it. By now they're interested to know where you came from (if you're doing your job right ;)
        <h5>This is an event created by:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://webmaker.org">Mozilla</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla">@Mozilla</a>)</li>
            <li> and generously hosted at the fantastic Location-where-you-are (Always say thanks to people or organizations that donate space or volunteers!) </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>[1hr 20 mins] Hands on Hacking</h4>
          <p>Everyone forms groups and collaborate to do the <a href="../hacktivityGrid.html#handson">Hands on Hacking Hacktivity</a> (for example the <a href="../PopcornPrototype/hh_culturalheritage_popcorn.html">Cultural Heritage Remix</a> Hacktivity). This make session is about team work and composition. How do groups work out the design challenge? Advise that they can make multiple pages, but that they should set requirements and plan together. Each group plans, collects assets, builds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>[30 min] Closing Circle</h4>
          <p>Use the closing circle to see what everyone made and ask questions like:
          <ul>
            <li>What did you make?</li>
            <li>What did you learn?</li>
            <li>Do you have questions?</li>
            <li>How would you like to follow up?</li>
            <li>Were you excited?</li>
            <li>Did you have fun?</li>
            <li>What will you do next?</li>
            <li>How would you change this workshop?</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </li>

  <h1>Agenda</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>[25 mins] Introductions, Persona Set Up and Profiling</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Start by introducing yourself and explaining what YOU want them to learn. Include links to the workshop <a href="http://etherpad.mozilla.org">etherpad</a> and explain that you're keeping a pad to stay connected, catalog links and share work. Ask questions to get an idea of who's there and peers that can pair up to help one another.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Who can code?</li>
            <li>Who can teach?</li>
            <li>Who has experience with Webmaking tools specifically?</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Introductions</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>To keep introductions short, use a prompt that allows people to say a single unique thing. For example, "My name is, I work on/for/at, and if you really knew me, you'd know..."</li>
            <li>A Facilitator has to be willing to make a fool out of him/herself, so choose a game to loosen people up and be animated in the way you  begin. People are self conscious, show them that you see everyone as 100% awesome. Try to remain positive the entire time. When you have "problem people" be firm, but nice, and remember you're the workshop leader.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Persona and the Badge Backback</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Get everyone to set up <a href="http://login.persona.org">Persona</a> and their <a href="http://beta.openbadges.org">Badge Backpack</a></li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Profiling</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Have participants draw themselves and label the drawing with one word that they self identify as and their names. Add other information about themselves while eating.</li>
            <li>This exercise helps facilitators make associations between words, names and faces. Plus it helps you judge the personality-type that people have. If people feel like you're trying to know them, they LET you teach. EVERYONE likes hands on exercises ;)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>[30 mins ***FOOD***</h4>
          <p>Feed people. Or at least give them coffee. It's good to give people a topic to talk about while they're eating.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>[15 mins] Spectrogram</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Use a hacktivity (like the <a href="../PopcornPrototype/ib_spectrogram_popcorn.html">Spectrogram</a>) that introduces the topic for the day. This puts participants in a particular mind frame and prepares them for knowledge acquisition.
              <ul>
                <li>Anyone who writes in this day and age, is writing for the web.</li>
                <li>It's important that everyone learn basic HTML and CSS.</li>
                <li>This is another set of tools to do excellent journalism.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
            <li>
              <h4>[10 mins] Break into Groups</h4>
              <p>No one has to work alone. They will work independently, but with peers. Oh, sounds impossible? No, participants get to ask the person next to them for help instead of raising your hand. This isn't elementary school! Explain that you'll be floating and help people that get stuck. Tell people to work with people they don't know!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>[30 mins] MAKE</h4>
              <p>Everyone starts doing a the Diving In Hacktivity: <a href="http://hivenyc.org/OpenNewsPrototype/su_remixthenews_thimble.html">Remix the News</a>. You float. Be sure to point people to the <a href="http://hivenyc.org/CrashCourses/cs_html.html">HTML</a> and the <a href="http://hivenyc.org/CrashCourses/cs_css.html">CSS</a> Cheatsheets</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>
          <h4>[20 mins] Who are we and why are we working together? (+Q&A)</h4>
        <li>Recircle and give people context about you or your organization. Never do this at the beginning of a session, but do it. By now they're interested to know where you came from (if you're doing your job right ;)

          <h4>[1hr 20 mins] MAKE</h4>
          <p>Everyone forms groups and collaborate to do the Hands on Hacking Hacktivity: <a href="http://hivenyc.org/OpenNewsPrototype/hh_biastheNews_thimble.html">Bias the News</a>. This make session is about team work and composition. How do groups work out the design challenge? Advise that they can make multiple pages, but that they should set requirements and plan together. Each group plans, collects assets, builds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>[30 min] Closing Circle</h4>

            <li>What did you make?</li>
            <li>What did you learn?</li>

    <!--An icebreaker is an activity that gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own! -->
    <h3>Icebreaker</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>The Spectrogram uses short, controversial or extreme statements to begin a discussion about the topics of the day. <br/>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Come up with <strong>three statements that introduce essential themes</strong>. For example:
	    <ul>
		    <li>Interaction adds value to a story.</li>
		    <li>A story always has a beginning, middle, and end.</li>
		    <li>A film made for and with the web can win an Oscar.</li>
    </li>
    <li class="right"> 
      <p><strong>Place post its</strong> with the numbers one to ten written on them in a line on the floor or wall.  Leave enough space for people to separate along the line.</p>
    </li>
    <li>      <p><strong>Explain the activity</strong> to the participants: You will read a statement and if they completely agree with that statement, they should stand near the number 10. If they completely disagree, they should stand near the number 1. Those whom somewhat agree would stand at number 5. Tell the participants that they can change their minds based on what other participants say.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right"><img src="static/ib_popcorn/step04_spectrogram.png" class="right"/>
      <p><strong>Read the first statement</strong> and once participants have divided themselves along the line, ask  someone why they are standing where they are standing. <strong>Use the activity to begin a discussion and debate on the essential themes of the day.</strong></p>

    <!--An icebreaker is an activity that gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own! -->
    <h3>Icebreaker</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Participants will learn how to develop a procedural story by defining rules and then using them to create a story.<br/>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li> <img src="static/ib_popcorn/step01_writetheRules.png" alt="step01_writetheRules" width="135" height="145"><p>Explain that a procedural story is a set of rules a story follows, not the story itself. These rules ensure that the story is different every time. Collectively come up with the first “rule” of a story. Usually, the first rule will be the theme of the story (e.g. “The story has to be about robots”).</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right"> <img src="static/ib_popcorn/step02_writetheRules.png" alt="step02_writetheRules" width="135" height="100" class="right">
      <p>Break into 3 groups, have each group come up with a rule the story has to follow. Assign the categories “characters”, “perspective” and “action”. The “characters” group comes up with a rule that designates the “who” of the story. The perspective group finds a rule for “how” the story is told (from which perspective). The “action” group comes up with “what” happens in the story.</p>
    </li>
    <li><img src="static/ib_popcorn/step03_writetheRules.png" alt="step03_writetheRules" width="155" height="118">
      <p>Once the rules are written, post them on the wall and have each group create a story. Also have learners suggest ways a user could participate in the story.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right"><img src="static/ib_popcorn/step04_writetheRules.png" alt="step04_writetheRules" width="135" height="103" class="right">
      <p>Finally, have learners present their stories to the group. Have  participants talk  about their stories.</p>

   <!--A setting up activity is one that gives pointed instruction to participants on tools or procedures. An example of a setting up activity would be allowing the participants to get used to the interface of Thimble or Popcorn by having them make projects. Before learners can practically apply new skills, they need to be comfortable with the tools they'll be using and have a basic understanding of the skills they'll be sharpening. -->
    <h3>Setting Up</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Learners use HTML to remix and show others how to make or do something, by creating their own step-by-guide and publishing it to the web.<br/>

      <p> Float around to help learners that get stuck. In the Hands on Hacking hacktivity, learners will have a specific task to complete, so for now, allow them to play with Thimble and get used to the interface. If learners have already created a How-to video, ask them to switch out the videos.</p>

    <p>Have learners publish their projects and post them to a blog or save links in an Etherpad.</p>

    <h1>Discussion</h1>
    <p>Have participants talk about their hacks and display their pages. Ask them what they had to do to create their project. Reinforce the idea that in HTML, elements have opening and closing tags. Ask learners why syntax and web standards are important. Ask them why an open web is important.</p><p>
Following the presentations, facilitators should direct participants to other resources in their community or online to learn more about hacking and web design/development. Provide individual constructive feedback during presentations.</p>  </div>

    <!--An icebreaker is an activity that gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own! -->
    <h3>Icebreaker</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Learners explore and discuss the history of media while creating a dynamic web of string. The facilitator should think of this hacktivity as a guided discussion, allow learners to explore themes while guiding them if their answers do not make sense.<br/>

    <!--An icebreaker is an activity that gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own! -->
    <h3>Icebreaker</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Mindmapping is a great way to record ideas, outline concepts and show thought progression. Participants will brainstorm by creating Mindmaps for the How-tos they will build using the <a href="hh_buildinghowto_popcorn.html">Building the How-to hacktivity</a>. <br/>

      <p>Explain that each participant will write 3 to 5 ideas related to How tos. You may wish to give them specific guidelines that relate to other learning objectives you have. For example, if you would like your learners to create How Tos that explain how to use a particular web tool, have them write out different tools or processes they would like to explain.</p>

    <li><img src="../static/ib_popcorn/step03_writetheRules.png" alt="step03_writetheRules" width="155" height="118">
      <p>Have learners generate statements, drawings, and words that expand upon each idea. They can expand on their own ideas or one of their peers.</p>

      <p>Finally, have learners present their mindmaps to the group. Have participants talk about the process and discuss new ideas that arose from the activity.</p>

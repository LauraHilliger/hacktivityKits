    <!--A setting up activity is one that gives pointed instruction to participants on tools or procedures. An example of a setting up activity would be allowing the participants to get used to the interface of Thimble or Popcorn by having them make projects. Before learners can practically apply new skills, they need to be comfortable with the tools they'll be using and have a basic understanding of the skills they'll be sharpening. -->
    <h3>Setting Up</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>The goal of this hacktivity is for participants to create a paper prototype and plan for the How To video they'll be creating with Popcorn Maker.<br/>

      <p>If you havenâ€™t already, visit the Popcorn <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/">here</a>. Tell participants that they will be hacking a video. On the Popcorn page, click the <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/templates/basic/?savedDataUrl=tutorial.json">"Take a Tutorial"</a> button. This gives an introduction to Popcorn Maker and shows the learner how to use the interface.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right"><img src="../static/su_popcorn/step02_groupPopcorn.png" alt="step02_groupPopcorn" width="121" height="136" class="right">
      <p>Allow learners to work individually or together. After a few minutes of playing with the tutorial, you might also allow learners to choose the Beginner Popcorn Maker project they would like to work  with.</p>

      <p> Float around to help learners that get stuck. In the Hands on Hacking hacktivity, learners will have a specific task to complete, so for now, allow them to play with Popcorn and get used to the interface.</p>

    <li class="right">
    <p>Have learners publish their projects and post them to a blog or save links in an Etherpad.</p>

    <h1>Discussion</h1>
    <p>Have participants talk about their films. Ask them what they had to do to make a story of their own. Reinforce the idea that Popcorn allows them to pull in dynamic data. Ask learners what the difference between a traditional film and a web native film is.</p><p>
Following  the presentations, facilitators should direct participants to other resources in their community or online to learn more about storytelling, user participation and interactivity. Provide individual constructive feedback during presentations.</p>  </div>

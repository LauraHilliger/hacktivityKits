    <!--An icebreaker is an activity that gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own! -->
    <h3>Icebreaker</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Learners play with the Gender Remixer to understand how context can change when images and text are remixed. In addition, learners will explore gender issues in advertising.<br/>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li> <img src="../static/ib_popcorn/step02_writetheRules.png" alt="step02_writetheRules" width="135" height="100">Start by having learners access the <a href="http://www.genderremixer.com/lego/" target="_blank">Gender Remixer</a> and create audio and video mashups.
    </li>
    <li class="right"> 
      <p>Allow learners to explore the tool for a few minutes. Explain that they are viewing mashups. A mashup is the result of is putting together two pieces of content to create new meaning.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p></p>
    </li>
    <li class="right">
      <p>Gather learners into a group and begin a discussion around how the context of the ads changed when they create mash ups. Show other examples of mashups. Discuss, for example, what learners would think if this demotivational poster didn't have text. Or if this meme didn't have an image.</p>

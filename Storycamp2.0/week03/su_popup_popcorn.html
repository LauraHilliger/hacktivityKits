    <!--A setting up activity is one that gives pointed instruction to participants on tools or procedures. An example of a setting up activity would be allowing the participants to get used to the interface of Thimble or Popcorn by having them make projects. Before learners can practically apply new skills, they need to be comfortable with the tools they'll be using and have a basic understanding of the skills they'll be sharpening. -->
    <h3>Setting Up</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>The goal of this hacktivity is for learners to remix the context of a video by adding pop ups and new commentary.<br/>

    <li><img src="../static/su_popcorn/step01_openPopcornGetStarted.png" alt="step01_openPopcorn" width="165" height="142">
      <p>Visit the Make a Popup Video project <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/projects/make-pop-video/">here</a>. Tell participants that they will be remixing a video by adding popups that change the context of the video. On the Project page, click the <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/templates/basic/?savedDataUrl=/api/remix/1067">"Get Started"</a> button.</p>
     <p>You might want to give specific guidance on <em>how</em> they should change the context. For example, ask them to create popups that take a political position on what happens in the video. Alternatively, you might ask them to create a commentary on gender bias in the video.</p>

    <li class="right"><img src="../static/su_popcorn/step02_groupPopcorn.png" alt="step02_groupPopcorn" width="121" height="136" class="right">
      <p>Allow learners to work individually or together. Have learners find a video they would like to comment on through <a href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">You Tube</a>. Once learners have found a video to work with, have them copy the URL and bring it into Popcorn Maker.</p>

    <li> <img src="../static/su_popcorn/step03_PopcornInterfaceMedia.png" alt="step03_PopcornInterface" width="165" height="116">
      <p>Learners should start by replacing the Media Source URL. Float around to help learners that get stuck. </p>

    <p>Have learners publish their projects and post them to a blog or save links in an Etherpad.</p>

    <h1>Discussion</h1>
    <p>Have participants talk about their films. Ask them what they had to do to change the context of the video. Reinforce the idea that Popcorn allows them to pull in dynamic data. Ask learners what the difference between a traditional film and a web native film is.</p><p>
Following  the presentations, facilitators should direct participants to other resources in their community or online to learn more about storytelling and remixing. Provide individual constructive feedback during presentations.</p>  </div>
